    It''s missing WordPress ... why are they still using blogger? Personally I associate
    blogspot addresses with personal journals and spam blogs.


    How do you find WP?

    J: Yeah, likewise, and I did suggest that we should use WP, but it all got set
    up and started while I wasn''t paying attention...  I''m really liking WP -- it''s
    exceptionally easy to use, looks pretty and has all the add-ins I could ever want.  Definitely
    much more suitable for hosting my web site than Plone (its previous incarnation)
    was.  And definitely more usable than MT (which I used for a previous blog, long,
    long ago).  The only major downside for me is that it''s written in PHP -- I have
    no previous experience of PHP and no real desire to learn it.  However, I''m discovering
    that it''s easy enough to tweak things when I need to, since PHP looks not entirely
    dissimilar to C/Perl...'

Looking at some other projects, I realise the major thing that <a href="http://www.logicalware.com/" title="Email Response Management">MailManager</a> is missing is snazzy release names.  In the world of <a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="Debian GNU/Linux">Debian</a>, we have releases named after characters in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0114709/">Toy Story</a> -- hamm, slink, potato, woody, sarge and now etch.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has big cats -- Tiger, Panther, Jaguar -- and the next in line is suggested as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger">Liger</a> in the blogging world.

So, what theme should the <a href="http://www.logicalware.com/" title="Email Response Management">MailManager</a> releases have?  I'm thinking beer or pub names, but it has to have <em>some</em> sort of International appeal, and it probably wouldn't be a great idea to infringe other people's copyright or trademarks.  So what do you think?
