I'm currently working my way through [Agile Web Development with Rails](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/097669400X/mathieoftheen-21) and, every time I get into reading it, I keep getting really excited about doing some sort of development work with it.  From my past year's experience of using the [Zope](http://www.zope.org/) platform, I keep seeing things about how [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) operates (in particular this morning, while reading all about ActiveRecord) and seeing how much easier it is to express particular ideas.  I really want to try a spike of porting [MailManager](http://www.logicalware.com/) to Rails, just to see if it's really as easy as it looks.  I guess that's something I'd have to do in my spare time, though, unless somebody can think of a vital business case for it...?

Actually, I think there <em>is</em> a reasonable business case for it: we get to ride the wave that Rails is currently generating.  I think that would be fantastic from a marketing point of view.  It'd also clean up our code drastically, since it would be a case of shifting the <em>concepts</em> across, rather than a copy'n'paste of code.

On the downside, it would slow down the development of new features.  Again.  (We've basically now gone through 2 major iterations -- 2.0 and 2.1 -- where we're not implementing many exciting new features, just rebuilding the existing system for scalability, reliability and conformance to current standards.)  That wouldn't be good from a business point of view.  We'd also probably really annoy the existing open source user base (though it shouldn't make any real difference to our hosted user base, who are the folks that are paying us money...).

But anyway, I seem to have gotten sidetracked.  The point I was getting at was that Rails <em>excites</em> me, it motivates me, it makes me <em>want</em> to find some reason to do development in it.  It's been a while since I've thought that about a development platform...
