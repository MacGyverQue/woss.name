Seeing as [everyone](http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/10#GemSurvey) [else](http://chadfowler.com/2007/2/11/show-us-your-gems) [has](http://smartic.us/2007/2/11/show-us-your-gems) [contributed](http://blog.alancfrancis.com/2007/02/gemmin_with_the.html), here's the gems currently installed on my machine:

Nothing particularly exciting in there, really.  I recently reinstalled ruby, so the gems are pretty much just what I'm using for apps I'm actively developing.  Though puppet's just there, well, because somebody mentioned it this morning and I thought I'd have a nosey...

Oh, BTW, I'm signed up and going to [RailsConf '07](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/)!  How cool is that?  I've never really been to the U S of A before.  Well, I went to Florida for a 2 week holiday with my parents, doing Disneyland, when I was a kid, but that doesn't really count.  I'm *sooo* excited! :-)
