Derek: I don't think I managed to tell you at the time, but <em>thank you<&#47;em> for that speech.  It was wonderful, absolutely perfect.  And the one thing the folks who only get to read it are going to miss was that your delivery was stunning too.

Has anybody else posted about our wedding?  I'd like to collate all the posts into a 'memories of the day' page on the wedding web site (that I <em>will<&#47;em> get around to setting up sometime soon!).  In the mean time, though, I've uploaded one of the images; click the thumbnail to the left for a bigger version.
