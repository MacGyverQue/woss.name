OK, so I stumbled upon [Working With Rails](http://workingwithrails.com/) a while back when there was a little controversy about their methods for populating the database with Rails developers and I figured I should claim my record.  I filled in a few details then forgot about it.  I visited again today to mention that I'm a Rails core contributor (well, I've had a patch or two accepted, which is good enough for me!) after reading that [CD Baby is sponsoring conferences passes for the top 20 contributors](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2007/1/8/hackfest-2007-and-cdbaby-sprint) between now and the conference registration opening for [RailsConf '07](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/).  I sincerely doubt that, with my current workload, I'll either contribute much or make it to the American RailsConf, but why not sign up anyway? :-)

While I was visiting Working With Rails, I noticed that some kind people have recommended me!  How nice is that?  And so I thought I'd give you all the opportunity to do the same: [Recommend me on Working With Rails](http://workingwithrails.com/recommendation/new/person/5135-graeme-mathieson). :-)

I'm aware that this here blog has been a little content-light this year so far.  I've just started a huge new project for a brand new customer, and I've already signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Hopefully I'll still be able to talk about what I'm doing in broad terms, but it'll take a little while to figure out how far I can go.  Anyway, I'm spending so much time working just now (this new project is full time, and I've still got other clients to see to in the evenings and weekends!) that I don't have much time to blog.

Still, the project is really exciting, and it's great fun to be leading a small team of developers, rather than working on my own.  I'd forgotten how much more I get out of work when I can bounce ideas off other people!

**Update** Pah, it turns out you can't recommend yourself.  But I have met me, used code I've written, heard me speaking at events, and would highly recommend me! :-)

**Update 2** Yeah, I am very behind on my RSS feed reading too.  Why do you ask?
