So I'm at the [Adobe Store](https://store2.adobe.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-UK&nr=0#view=ols_prod&loc=en_gb&store=OLS-UK&categoryOID=1609645&distributionOID=103&nr=0) ready to buy Lightroom.  Well, I'm not actually going to buy it yet, since I still need permission from She Who Must Be Obeyed which will hopefully happen soon because I've only got one day left in the trial...  Anyway, I'm reckoning that I don't have the patience to wait for the box to be delivered, so I'll go with the download option instead.  I click the drop-down to select 'download' (not that I need to actually download it -- It's already there and installed!).  The price changes.  It **increases** by Â£4.37!  What's with that?  Is it more expensive for them to deliver content *that they've already delivered* online rather then provide printed manuals and boxes?

Interestingly, the price isn't different in the US store.

Oh, and don't get me started about the fact that Lightroom costs Â£150 in the UK, *ordered from the same web site for online delivery* yet it's $199 (which is currently Â£101.38!) for US folks.  I'm in the process of seeing if I can order from the US store... **Update** Which I can't, because it requires a credit card address in the United States!
