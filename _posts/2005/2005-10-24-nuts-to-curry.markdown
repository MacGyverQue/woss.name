Oops.  Annabel and I decided to treat ourselves to takeaway curry last night, from the local Indian restaurant we've bought from several times previously.  Annabel had her usual -- a Sabzi Pasanda -- and I ordered a Nawabi Bindi Ghosht, along with a couple of portions of vegetable pakora, some rice and a garlic &amp; coriander nan bread.  Dinner was delivered just in time for the final episode of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/monarch/">Monarch of the Glen</a> (not that I've ever really watched it before, so I had to keep asking who people were and what was going on, much to Annabel's annoyance, I guess, as she used to watch it avidly and so was keen to see the <em>last ever episode</em>).  So we settled down and munched our way through the lovely pakora.  I had some of my own curry, which is absolutely fantastic.

Then I decided to have a taste of Annabel's.  A few mouthfuls in, I get this sensation that hasn't happened in a long time, but which I clearly remember.  My mouth and throat are swelling up.  Peanuts.  The bloomin' curry has peanuts in it!  (For those of you playing along at home, I am allergic to peanuts.)   I stop eating, drink a lot of water to try to wash away the taste, the sensation, but it won't disappear.  I'm conscious that I'm having difficulty swallowing.  However, my main concern at this point is that I <em>know</em> I'm going to be sick.  It usually takes a while, but it always happens.  So I spend much of the next hour with my head resting over the toilet bowl, spitting that vile taste, that vile sensation away and waiting.  My throat is still feeling dry and swollen.  I ask Annabel to find me a bucket, so I can go lie down instead of sitting over the toilet (I'm beginning to feel really tired, just want to lie down) and, within minutes of her finding the bucket, sure enough, dinner makes a comeback.  It's quite a relief, really.

I phoned my mum, just to see if there's anything else I should do.  At the mention of my throat swelling, she's adamant: <q>Go to casualty.  Now.</q>  So we do.  I was seen by a nurse very quickly, hooked up to a system, to monitor my heart and blood pressure, and left to it.  To be honest, I was already starting to feel better; throwing up seemed to have helped flush the nuts out of my system.  By the time the doctor turned up about an hour later, I was feeling like a complete fraud.  He checked me out, looking for swelling in my throat, which seemed (even to me) to have subsided, feeling my stomach (which then made it really hurt and made me feel nauseus for the rest of the night -- but I figured it'd pass and he was already threatening to keep me in for observation, so I didn't mention it), checking my breathing.  I was fine.  And allowed to go home.

I've been taking Piriton tablets (anti-histamines) since, which I recall having helped in the past, but they have the bonus side effect of making me really drowsy (and grumpy), so I slept in a bit this morning, and I'm just heading into work shortly.  And I'm having the temptation to go to the doctor and get myself prescribed an <a href="http://www.epipen.com/">EpiPen</a> -- what if I hadn't noticed it so quickly (say I'd had a few beers, my senses were a bit dulled?) and I'd eaten more of the curry?

It was an interesting experience.  One I'd quite happily not have again.  I've kinda gone off curry now. :-(
