Has anybody else noticed that [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/)'s CVS repositories seem a little erratic over the past couple of days?

{% highlight bash %}
mathie@Tandoori:mailmanager-2.0.1$ cvs add sql/setTableCharsets.zsql
ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
cvs [add aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages if any)
{% endhighlight %}

I'm getting these sorts of errors about 4 times in every 5...
