Well, Annabel and Margaret (her mum) will currently be on a plane, flying south to Barcelona, for their 'hen weekend'.  And I've been abadoned to my own devices for the weekend.  Well, not really, since <a href="http://drossy.net/blog/">Derek</a> is turning up this evening for a quiet weekend of kilt-measuring-up and maybe a couple of beers here or there.  (Current known plans: this evening at The Regent from around 17:30 onwards, tomorrow night at The Holyrood from about 18:00 onwards -- join us if you want!)  Yeah, maybe just a couple of beers... :-)

Now, how to outdo last year?  See, around this time last year, Annabel and Margaret had a long weekend in Prague.  And while they were away, I sneakily sneaked my nice wide screen television into the flat (it had previously been refused entry, since it was <q>too big</q>) along with the xbox, lots of DVDs and some games.  How on earth do I <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">top</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/">that</a>? :-)  If only the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/">Xbox 360</a> was already available in the UK...
