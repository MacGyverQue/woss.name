    I see you''re using Mac''s, nice choice.  However, are you using Safari as well?  Normally
    the quick buttons don''t display in Safari :(  Firefox works well however.  Cheers!'

  content: ! 'You''re absolutely right!  I''m using Safari and the QuickTags don''t
    appear to work there.  I''d been wondering what QuickTags were anyway. :-)  Switching
    to Firefox makes it work perfectly.  I guess I should re-evaluate whether to use
    Safari or Firefox day-to-day.


    Thanks!'

It's probably plainly obvious that the main software powering this beastie is WordPress.  But I thought I'd give a mention to all the other bits and pieces I'm using (or planning to use) to make my blogging life complete:

<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.chroder.com&#47;archives&#47;2005&#47;04&#47;16&#47;wordpress-codehighlight-plugin&#47;">CodeHighlight<&#47;a> for doing automatic syntax highlighting of anything I mark up as being 'code'.  This should be most excellent for posting up wee code snippets now and again.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.huddledmasses.org&#47;">Acronym replacer<&#47;a> which, FYI, spots when I've used an acronym and wraps it in an [code lang="xml"]<acronym title="expansion">TLA<&#47;acronym>[&#47;code] tag.  The result of which is that, when you hover over the acronym in your browser, a tooltip will pop up explaining what it means.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;rawlinson.us&#47;blog&#47;?p=212">RSS Fetched Link List<&#47;a> for automatically retrieving my latest posts from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;del.icio.us&#47;mathie&#47;">my del.icio.us<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rockschtar.de&#47;wp-plugin-sh-autolink&#47;">sh-autolink<&#47;a> for automatically turning particular keywords into links.  I'm not sure I like this one, yet.  The one modification I've already made is to replace the 'target' field with 'title'.  I strongly dislike the use of target="_blank" -- it's up to <strong>me<&#47;strong>, as the browser of a page, whether I want to open up a new window (or tab!), not the designer of the web site!  But anyway, it's a bit cack-handed about replacing stuff (like things that are already enclosed in an anchor tag), so it at least needs tweaking before I'll be happy with it.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;boneill.ninjagrapefruit.com&#47;wp-tag-plugin&#47;">Technorati Tagging<&#47;a> for adding tags to all my posts and displaying the most often used tags in a neat way in the sidebar.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;manalang.com&#47;archives&#47;2004&#47;06&#47;23&#47;wordpress-plugin-wp-amazon">wp-amazon<&#47;a>, which will be really neat after I've gotten it working.  So far, however, the link for adding an Amazon item, well, isn't where it should be.  I can't find it anywhere on the 'write post' page...  I'll persevere.<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

I'm sure I'll go hunting for more plug-ins soon.  In particular, I'll be looking for something to integrate wp with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gallery.sf.net&#47;" title="Gallery's home page">Gallery 2<&#47;a> soon.
