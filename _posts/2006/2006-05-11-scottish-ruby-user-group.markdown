    coast)... how about setting up some kind of mailing list?</p>


    <p>I''ve been looking for a local group for months to develop my skills and (more
    importantly) motivate me. All I''d found so far was the Agile Scotland group (ClarkeChing.com).
    It''s not really ruby though, more agile practices...</p>'

    Is it the plan to have a monthly meeting? If so please consider choosing a different
    night.</p>

... for want of a better name. :)

The inaugural meeting of the Scottish Ruby User Group has been arranged!  We'll be meeting in [The Regent](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/17/17127/Regent/Edinburgh), 2 Montrose Terrace, Edinburgh on Thursday 25th May, from 19:00 onwards.  Chances are we'll be in the back room.

The Regent's a great pub, near enough to Waverley Station for non-Edinburgers, with free Wi-fi access and a lovely selection of beers, ciders, spirits and wine.  Orkney Dark Island is making a regular appearance on the pumps these days.

There's nothing formal arranged for this meeting; it's just a chance to get the ball rolling, see who's interested in Ruby around Scotland and to have a chat with a few beers.

To hear further announcements about Scottish Ruby User Group meetings, please subscribe to the [mailing list](http://lists.rubaidh.com/listinfo.cgi/scotruby-rubaidh.com).

I hope to see you there. :)
