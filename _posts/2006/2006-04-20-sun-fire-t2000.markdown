I'm currently staring at a spinning `/`, trying to drown out the noise of fans below me with Placebo:

    Sun Fire T200, No Keyboard
    Copyright 2005 Sun Microsystems, Inc.  All rights reserved.
    OpenBoot 4.19.0, 8184 MB memory installed, Serial #67267664.
    Ethernet address 0:14:4f:2:6c:50, Host ID: 84026c50.

Yeah, that's right, I have just received an evaluation [Sun Fire T2000](http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t2000/test/overview_a.jsp?name=A) for 60 days to play around with.  Very first impressions?  **Argh!** I had to go speak nicely to my local [Sun Resellers](http://www.accesscomputing.co.uk/) to borrow a serial console cable since it didn't ship with one.  I then had to dig out an old PC laptop with a working serial port and get that running with `minicom` just so that I could set up the network ALOM interface.  But now I have it booting and I'm doing the initial configuration.

The idea is that I'm going to attempt to do some [detailed performance analysis](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20060221) of the machine running RoR apps, comparing it to the Quad G5 I have sitting next to me.  Hopefully, I might even then be able to deploy it somewhere, running RoR apps. :)
