Trawling through my news feeds this morning, a nuumber of people mentioned the release of [Yojimbo](http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml) from Bare Bones Software.  I've had it on my kGTD todo list for a while to evaluate [Devonthink Pro](http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php) as a general reference system for my GTD mind-like-alcohol (just like Dave Allen's Mind Like Water, only confuses people and is potentially dangerous!) workflow.  Only I've never gotten around to doing it.  And BB claims that this one is *so* simple to use, that it's fully integrated with Tiger technologies.

It looks pretty enough.  I do particularly like the Drop Dock, for dragging random useful things to (although I wish in could be positioned on the bottom of the screen, either side of the dock, since that's effectively dead space for me).  It seems pretty fast, very easy to use.  But, from a 10 minute overview while I was eating my breakfast, here are the additional features I would like:

* Tags.  I use [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) and [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) tags a lot.  And I would like to implement the same sort of system for my own personal data store.  It's lazier than creating a proper, ordered taxonomy, but it's also quicker (particularly if the system is set up to remind you of the tags you've already used) and I find it useful.  OK, so most of the words that I'd choose as tags are already mentioned in anything I'd store (or I could paste it on the end, or add it in the comments myself, I suppose), but I tend to 'normalise' things slightly so that it's easier for me to find.  I guess using labels is getting there, but I want more than 8 tags, and I work better with words than colours.

* Nested collections.  I suspect I'll wind up with so many different collections of material that the folder list down the left will become unweildy.

* Smart collections.  Rather than having to manually add items to particular library collections, I'd like to generate collections automatically from some metadata.

* Lots more metadata.  I likes metadata. :-)

I think I'll persevere with it over the 30 day trial, see if I can make it fit into my workflow.  After all, I'm already finding it easy enough to use that I'm randomly dragging 'useful' web pages into it for later grepability.
