  content: ! 'My understanding is that, if you approach a company "as a consumer"
    - i.e. they have no reason to believe that you''re a business, and they quote
    you a price without mentioning VAT, you can assume that they''ve included it in
    said quote.


    If you engage their services at said price and they then add VAT on top, you can
    legitimately dispute it on the grounds that they''ve mispriced.

  content: They do explicitly say &pound;x.xx+VAT for every price, so I guess that
    doesn't count.  It's just sly, though, because when you're discussing it and comparing
    quotes, you always think of the &pound;x.xx bit and not remember to count the
    VAT.

As part of our negotiations with the caterers for the wedding, I just asked:

<blockquote>
  <p>I take it there are no costs to us for you providing the bar?  I don't suppose we'd get some commission on bar sales? :-)  Knowing my mates, that'd pay for the meal by itself! :-)<&#47;p>
<&#47;blockquote>

and

<blockquote>
  <p>Personally, I think we can dispense with having two wine glasses and a water glass per person for the meal; if they want to drink both red and white wine, they can sloosh out their glass with a bit of water in between!  Would that make any difference to the cost?<&#47;p>
<&#47;blockquote>

And apparently, according to Annabel, <q>you're great at this!<&#47;q>  I thought I was just being silly...  It seems like we're quibbling over tiny details now that aren't actually going to make a significant difference to the cost, whereas what I actually want to say is <q>knock off the &pound;4+VAT corkage per guest and you've got yourself a deal.<&#47;q>  (Since we've got approximately 100 guests in total, that is a big deal!)  But I don't feel brave enough to try that...

That's another thing.  It's really bugging me that our catering company always quote their prices without VAT.  Now I realise that they also do corporate functions and deal with business customers a lot, so quoting prices excluding VAT is standard there.  But when you're dealing with <em>consumers<&#47;em> (ie the folks that have to pay VAT -- the likes of us!) wouldn't it be polite to give them an accurate cost up front?  In fact, weren't a bunch of computer-selling companies rapped over the knuckles for doing exactly the same thing a few years back?
