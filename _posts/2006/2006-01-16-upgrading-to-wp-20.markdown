Well, that's me upgraded to <a title="Wordpress" href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> 2.0.  It seems to have happened reasonably painlessly -- all my existing plugins still appear to work OK, my theme still functions.  Other than the improved admin interface, I haven't really noticed anything exciting and new.  And it'll take me a wee while to get used to the new admin interface, find out where everything is that I usually tweak on edit (geo location, technorati tags, categories, etc).

If you happen to notice anything that's not working as it should, please let me know.
