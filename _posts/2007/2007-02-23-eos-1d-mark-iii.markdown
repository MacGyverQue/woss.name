Ooh, shiny!  Canon yesterday announced the release of the [Canon EOS-1D Mark III](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=14999).    Interestingly, it doesn't have the 16.7 megapixel full frame sensor of the 1Ds Mk II, but a 10.1 megapixel APS-H one which gives you a 1.3x conversion factor.  I guess that's how they've brought the price down (just looking at Jessops, the 1Ds Mk II retails at about Â£4,500 where the Mk III is on pre-order at Â£3,000).  However, it does record 14 bits per pixel, rather than the usual 12, so the tonal range is vastly better.  It has the neat sensor cleaning system that first appeared in the 400D.  I particularly like that it's got a nice big buffer for continuous shooting, letting you shoot 10fps for 30 raw frames (or 110 jpegs).

First thoughts?  I want to nab a second hand 1Ds Mk II from somebody who's upgrading.  Other than that, I think I'd rather have a 5D.  I (probably irrationally or ignorantly) like the idea of a full-frame sensor.
