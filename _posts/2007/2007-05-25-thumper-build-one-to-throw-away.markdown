I have planned to experiment with this machine for a while, then nuke it and reinstall.  I was planning to try out the latest OpenSolaris community release too (though after a chat with [Jason Lee](http://www.jlsync.com/) last week at RailsConf, I realise that might not be the most manageable solution in production) just to see what advantages I get from that.

But mainly I want to know how to reinstall the machine from scratch, and to have that documentation in place, just in case.  Trouble is, what with having 48 hard disks, oodles of RAM, 2 CPUs and a pair of redundant PSUs in 4U of rack space, Sun didn't manage to find room for a DVD drive.

So I'm going to have to relearn Jumpstart (which I've only used twice, the last time being ~8 years ago!).  I was thinking "hmm, I wonder if I can run it on Mac OS X", since that's the only other machines I've got around the house.  But then I thought, "well, of course I can, I've got Solaris running in a VMware image on my laptop anyway!"

But I don't need to figure all that out for a couple of weeks yet...
