I've just been reviewing our electricity bill online this morning, as I was reminded it was now available.  I keep having this sneaking suspicion that we spend an awful lot of money on electricity bills, but I can't quite figure out if we're being particularly wasteful, or whether it's just because electricity prices have risen sharply over the past few years.

The house we live in now has gas central heating with combination boiler, a gas fire, and a gas stove top, although it's an electric oven.  So in a way, our electricity consumption ought to have lowered from the flat we moved out of a couple of years ago, which was all electricity (and exceedingly draughty!).  I should check our old bills sometime and see how the consumption compares.

Anyway, over the past year, we've had an average consumption of 14.69 Kilowatt Hours per day.  That's for a two bedroom upper villa with two people living in it, both of whom are out at work most of the day.

So, I wonder.  Are we average?  Or are the neighbours nicking our electricity? :)
