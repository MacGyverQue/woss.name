My, I'm being verbose today, eh?  Anybody would think I was procrastinating instead of writing a huge wodge of documentation!  Anyway, for those of you that think the software that powers this site (<a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>) is really cool and want to run your own blog, but can't really be bothered maintain it, or sorting out hosting, or anything complicated like that, it would appear that you can now get a WordPress blog for free at <a href="http://wordpress.com/">http://wordpress.com/</a>.  So set it up, give it a shot, and tell me where you're blogging to the world.

Oh, and if you can be bothered with the occasional maintenance and hosting, might I pimp <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?wossname">DreamHost</a>, my happy hosting company, since I get a kickback if you sign up. :-)
