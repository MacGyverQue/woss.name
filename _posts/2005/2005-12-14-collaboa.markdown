Hmm, [Collaboa](http://collaboa.org/) looks like it could be interesting.  It seems to be just like something I had in the back of my mind to play around with creating: [Trac on Rails](http://www.edgewall.com/trac/).  Unfortunately it requires the Ruby bindings for Subversion, so it's not something that will be easy to installed on [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?wossname), but I might play around with a copy locally next week.
