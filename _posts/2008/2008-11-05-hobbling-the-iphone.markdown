I had a real "Doh!" moment today.  I'm in Florida for [RubyConf 2008](http:&#47;&#47;rubyconf.org&#47;) this week (which is going to be awesome!).  Unfortunately my luggage fared even worse than I did on its journey here and hasn't yet made it.  I have no transport, so I decided to go for a walk from the hotel to see if I could find a store to buy some toiletries and some clean clothes.

Just after I'd left the hotel, I had a brainstorm: "Aha, I'll see if the GPS thingume works on my iPhone across here."  Yes, that was a pretty stupid thing to ask myself all by itself.  The 'G' should have given that away.

So I fired up Google Maps on the iPhone.  It started off by showing me our house, which must have been the last time I launched maps.  I hit the locate-me button and sure enough, the pulsing blue widget appeared, showing me exactly where I was, moving slowly as I ambled down the sidewalk.

The downside?  I don't have data roaming switched on (as I don't want to have to declare myself bankrupt just yet, thanks).  So it was unable to download the maps for my location.  So it was just showing me moving along a set of grey squares.  Doh!

In the end I found a Walgreens, so I have toiletries, just no clean clothes.  For the sake of my fellow conference attendees, here's hoping my bag turns up soon!
