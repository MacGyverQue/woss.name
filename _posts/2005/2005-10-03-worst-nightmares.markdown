  content: Couldn't you have used the "It's bad luck for the groom to see the brides
    outfit before the wedding" superstition to avoid that nightmare altogether?  Surely
    shoes count as part of the outfit?

  content: Oh, I tried that one!  And failed miserably.  Apparently it's alright to
    see shoes, tiaras, that kind of thing.  It's just the dress itself that's bad
    luck.  I'm sure some people are making this up as they go along... :-)

Imagine your worst nightmare.  Well, in terms of shopping, anyway.  Does it involve looking for white, thick-heeled, high-heeled shoes for a wedding dress?  (For Annabel, not me!)  On a busy Saturday on Princes Street?  When fashion clearly seems to dictate that dark colours are in and white is <em>sooo</em> last season?  Four hours of trudging around Princes Street, first in one direction, then another, then back along the same way again (I think we traversed one of the blocks at least 4 times!), searching through all the 'fashionable' shops for white shoes.  Shops I'd never been into in my life before.  I'm amazed what passes for fashion these days.  (I think that's me getting really old, eh?)  Eventually, we found a suitable pair in the unfashionable John Lewis.  Four hours later.

Now, if that sounds bad enough, how about you compound it with looking through tartan tat shops on the Royal Mile, trying to find tartan ribbon?  It could have been worse -- it could have been festival-time -- but not by much.  But we were successful.

The shopping started off a bit better though: we now have on order a pair of 18ct white gold wedding rings (one plain court, 6mm wide for me, one with a celtic knot design for Annabel) from <a href="http://www.clarksonsedinburgh.co.uk/">Clarksons</a> on Victoria Street.  All their rings are made on the premises and bear the 'Edinburgh Hallmark', which sounds nice.  They came well recommended from Colin &amp; Fiona, Andrew &amp; Lisa, and Zoe &amp; Dan.

So we now have most of Annabel's attire for the day sorted out (ready for the fitting this week), ribbon for the wedding cake, wedding rings <em>and</em> we've ordered all the bits for the favours.  So it was a pretty successful day, really.  It just needed a bottle of wine back at home to recover. :-)
