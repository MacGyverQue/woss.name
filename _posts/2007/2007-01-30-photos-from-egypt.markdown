<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/374460546/" title="Long exposure from the front of the boat"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/164/374460546_b6ec73eb4b_m.jpg" alt="Long exposure from the front of the boat" class="alignright" style="border: solid 1px #000000; float: right;" /></a>I've finally started sorting through my photographs from our honeymoon in Egypt.  I've collated all the duplicates (from trying different bracketing, composition, or working in continuous exposure mode) and selected the 'best' of each.  I've made different albums of all the different locations we were.  And I've even touched up a few of the pictures (mostly just cropping, straightening or tweaking the white balance).<br />
<br />
So over the next couple of weeks, I intend to post a new photoset every day, for each place we visited, until we've made it through all the photographs.  I hope you like them!<br />
<br />
Please feel free to give me constructive criticism on the pictures and how I could have improved them.
