So, it's been a while, hasn't it?

Notes from a Messy Desk is back to running on Wordpress, which is a bit shinier than I remember it. And I'm back to posting, hopefully on a regular schedule. I've got a backlog of articles I'm aiming to tidy up and post over the next few weeks, and the interesting stuff I'm doing at [FreeAgent Towers](http:&#47;&#47;www.freeagentcentral.com&#47;) means I've always got plenty of material to turn into blog posts. :)

Anyhow, if you can see this, the transition has been successful. Unfortunately, I lost the comments on the articles authored in Squarespace because I restored from an old WP backup and transferred the rest across manually.

And it's still a bit of a work in progress. The theme's ... OK, but nothing special. And FeedBurner seems to be acting up. But we'll get there.
