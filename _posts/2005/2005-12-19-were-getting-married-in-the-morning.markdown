    three (!) in her ville of 15k souls.


    Based on casual observation, #2 was a 40''sh couple working the tax deadline (marrying
    on 31 Dec give you a deduction for the year in the U.S.A.) and #3, at 11:30 p.m.
    local, were part of the First Night festivities.


    As we enter our 38th year (21 Dec), I wish both of you many, many happy anniversaries.'

So it's nearly 0900 here in Musselburgh.  I'm sitting in the house, on my own, while everybody else rushes around organising themselves and each other.  Mum is off to the hairdressers and to have her makeup done.  Dad is ferrying people around.  Soon,  Mum, Dad, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;drossy.net&#47;blog&#47;">Derek<&#47;a> and Jim will be descending so we can get organised for the taxi arriving at 1245 to pick us up and take us to the church.  But for now, I'm relaxing, having a coffee and enjoying the calm before the storm. :-)

I haven't seen Annabel since about 1900 yesterday, and the next time I do see her will be as she's walking down the aisle alongside her dad!
