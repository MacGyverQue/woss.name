Today I've been having a quick play around with <a href="http://kinkless.com/articles/2005/10/04/kinkless-gtd-0-61-current">Kinkless GTD</a>, a Getting Things Done-like tool for <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">Omni Outliner</a>.  Unfortunately, it requires the professional edition, and I only own the standard edition, but I took the plunge and decided to pay the $29.95 for the upgrade.  Hey, it gives me the ability to record memos to myself too, so that's worth it all by itself, right? :-)  I've just been playing around with the default template so far, synchronising things, marking items as complete, seeing that it always picks me a next action for each project automatically.  If I can get into pushing all my to do lists onto Omni Outliner (something I've been intending to do anyway), I think this will seriously rock.

But I still have to block off some time to myself to actually sort out those big lists of stuff to do that are kicking around in my head (and in a few Omni Outliner documents, and on my whiteboard at work, and on the pad of paper neat to me at work, and in my Moleskine I carry around, and on bits of paper at home, and on the fridge at home, and ...!), into one neat place.
