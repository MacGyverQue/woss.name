  content: <p>Full ACK. But as far as i know there is no possibility to set a global
    default. But instead of right-clicking on the toolbar you could command-click
    on the button on top right of the window. Maybe this will bring you a small speedup

OK, this is one of these wee things that has been bugging me for a while,
particularly over the past week or so while I've been setting up my new
laptop. I don't like the default toolbar on Mac OS X, with its big icons and
textual descriptions for each icon. So every time I install and launch a new
application, I have to right click on the toolbar, and select 'Icon Only', then repeat, this time selecting 'Use Small Size'.  Every time.  Sometimes applications have multiple toolbars in different windows and I have to select my preference for them too.

My question: is there some way I can configure a global default so that it uses small icons and no text in my toolbars, throughout Mac OS X?
