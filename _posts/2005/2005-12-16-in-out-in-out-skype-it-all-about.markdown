OK, so I've been fiddling late on this afternoon, instead of writing [MailManager](http://www.logicalware.com/) documentation, like I'm supposed to be doing.  I've rediscovered [Skype](http://www.skype.com/), a telephone service utilising some strange VoIP technology.  I've bunged on some credit for SkypeOut and created myself a SkypeIn number (Edinburgh-based).  It's &pound;20 for a full year's subscription to SkypeIn -- I think I can cope with splashing out that much to play with it. :-)

Not that I've actually had a chance to talk to anybody else with it yet.  But I've spoken with our answering machine at home, I've talked to myself in the office (ah, [brings back memories](http://www.aculab.com/), eh?) and I've left messages on my voicemail.  It all seems to work pretty well, the quality is reasonable (better than a mobile phone, IME) and it's pretty cheap.  And they seem to have credited my account with double what they charged me.  I'm sure that'll fix itself shortly.

So yeah, if you're on Skype then [call me](skype:mathie_wossname?call), or [add me to your contacts list](skype:mathie_wossname?add).

And now, just as soon as I've finished annotating this screen shot, I shall be leaving the office.  For the rest of the year! :-)
