OK, I'm being a bit silly here.  I found [Ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/) this morning and was having a wee look through it.  Naturally I had a look at its statistics for the [Ruby on Rails project](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/34).  Apparently it would take 21 person years to reimplement it from scratch.  Wow, I think, that's a long time.  But then I noticed that it keeps track of the length of time individuals have been contributing (I guess by looking at their svn commits over time?).  Add up all those numbers for the Rails core team, and you get exactly 16 person years.

So, Ruby has allowed DHH et al to create Rails, which would have taken 21 person years in only 16.  If my math is right, that's about a 24% speed increase on Ohloh's metrics.

Of course, it all depends how Ohloh work out their metrics...
