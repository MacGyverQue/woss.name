The Guardian Online have an article on the [Top 20 geek novels](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2005/11/09/top_20_geek_novels_the_results.html), surveying the best of the 'geek' novels written in English since 1932.  The results are as follows, with the ones I have read highlighted in bold:

<ol class="compact">
<li><strong>The HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy -- Douglas Adams</strong></li>
<li><strong>Nineteen Eighty-Four -- George Orwell</strong></li>
<li>Brave New World -- Aldous Huxley</li>
<li><strong>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? -- Philip Dick</strong></li>
<li><strong>Neuromancer -- William Gibson</strong></li>
<li>Dune -- Frank Herbert</li>
<li><strong>I, Robot -- Isaac Asimov</strong></li>
<li><strong>Foundation -- Isaac Asimov</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Colour of Magic -- Terry Pratchett</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microserfs -- Douglas Coupland</strong></li>
<li><strong>Snow Crash -- Neal Stephenson</strong></li>
<li>Watchmen -- Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons</li>
<li><strong>Cryptonomicon -- Neal Stephenson</strong></li>
<li>Consider Phlebas -- Iain M Banks</li>
<li><strong>Stranger in a Strange Land -- Robert Heinlein</strong></li>
<li>The Man in the High Castle -- Philip K Dick</li>
<li><strong>American Gods -- Neil Gaiman</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Diamond Age -- Neal Stephenson</strong></li>
<li>The Illuminatus! Trilogy -- Robert Shea & Robert Anton Wilson</li>
<li>Trouble with Lichen - John Wyndham</li>
</ol>

I did try reading The Illuminatus! Trilogy -- really, I did.  But it's just, well, in my humble opinion, unreadable.  Completely deranged, switching from one scene (or narrative) to another with nary a paragraph break.  OK, perhaps I should give it another chance sometime, that maybe reading it while I was commuting regularly between Edinburgh and Milton Keynes wasn't the best time to try.  But I'd have to be really desperate to consider it!  I really should get around to trying some of Iain Bank's sci-fi stuff sometime.  I've read most of his other novels, but the only Iain <em>M</em> Banks novel I've ever read is State of the Art.
