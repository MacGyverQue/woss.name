Well, that was quick.  It's only taken me two posts to switch off the new rich text editor in [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) 2.0 and instead enable the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) plugin.  Actually I had never used that plugin before either, but I've been writing enough documentation recently, using Markdown, that I figured I'd give it a go here too.

Mostly the rich editor was irritating.  I'm not quite sure what it was doing behind the scenes, HTML-wise, it was a bit sluggish, and my fingers are wired towards actually writing HTML instead of having to hit clicky buttons.

So it's gone again.
