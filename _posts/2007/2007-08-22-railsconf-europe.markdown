Finally, I've gotten around to booking up everything for [RailsConf Europe](http://www.railsconfeurope.com/) -- flights, hotel, the conference itself.  I'm signed up for the all-day charity tutorial because, well, it's just a fundamentally good idea and well worth supporting/encouraging.  Though I hope Dave doesn't go quite as overboard about charitable donations as he did at RailsConf -- I'm paying a lot of money to go and talk to people about Rails, not to be lectured at about the money I give to charity!  I already give as much as I feel I can afford, thank you very much!

Anyway.

I've been plotting my plans for the time I'm in Berlin on Google Maps, messing around with creating my own map:

I'll be arriving at the hotel around 14:00 local time, I reckon, and I'm signed up for [Bratwurst on Rails](http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com/).  I'm open to making other plans if anybody wants to meet up on the Sunday afternoon?
