I've had a draft sitting around here for ages, intending to write up a quick list of the Mac OS X software I couldn't live without.  A meme going around (seemingly started <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/09/03/10macapps/" title="10 Mac Apps">here</a>) has prompted me to dust off the draft and write up something today.  I'm afraid I've failed to limit it to only small shareware/freeware apps, as I started running out of steam by number six.  What can I say?  I have a fairly limited set of applications I actually use.  So, top ten pieces of software I use on Mac OS X:

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, a text editor with all the bells and whistles you could ever want, very much suited to my style of working.  It's also my most recent discovery, which I've been using daily since I first downloaded it.  Work was terribly nice and registered it for me. :-)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.  Browsers are very controversial, personal choices, I guess, but having tried out Mozilla, Camino, Safari &amp; Opera, I still prefer Firefox.  Particularly with the web developer toolbar and a few Greasemonkey scripts added into the mix.</li>
  <li><a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>.  An RSS reader is pretty much essential to stay on top of lots of rapidly updating news sources and NetNewsWire is the best one I've found so far.  I've been using it for a couple of years now, and it's one of the first pieces of Mac shareware I registered.</li>
  <li><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> which, once properly configured and acclimatised to, allows one to do pretty much anything as a keyboard sequence.  I have it bound to ctrl-option-apple-space (basically the four consecutive keys at the left side of my keyboard, excluding fn on the laptop) and after I've hit that, I can launch applications by typing the first few letters of their name, or email somebody by typing part of their name, hitting tab, then selecting 'compose email'.  I can similarly display somebody's phone number, or past their address into the email I'm currently writing.  I can open a URL from my bookmarks (even del.icio.us bookmarks) by typing a few letters from it and hitting enter (for example, to check my online banking, I hit the shortcut, then type 'nat' and enter -- it knows what I'm looking for).  The learning curve is a little steep, but it's well worth the investment for the amount of time it saves in the long run.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>, the instant messaging client.  I don't use IM that much, and I used to always just use <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat/">iChat</a>, but I've recently been converted to Adium.  It stays out the way (iChat bugged me that it had a separate window for each account, and would only show the online status of one account at a time in the menu bar drop down) and has tabbed chat windows to make holding multiple simultaneous conversations less obtrusive.</li>
  <li><a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a>, a replacement for Apple's Terminal program.  Its only real advantage is that it has tabbed windows, so that I can have multiple shell sessions open without so much clutter.  Other than that, it's actually kinda irritating -- the performance seems poorer than Terminal, and I can't seem to convince the backspace key to work correctly in every situation (when it did with Terminal).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Adobe Photoshop</a> and Bridge, for messing around with photographs.  I'm no expert with Photoshop, but I can generally get it to work well enough for my needs, and I know it does a billion things I don't know how to get it to do.  I'm finding the Bridge to be much better than iPhoto for organising, applying metadata and tweaking my photographs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.quicken.com/">Quicken 2005</a>.  Actually, it's not <em>that</em> great a piece of software, it's doesn't support the UK, doesn't support my banks, isn't very well integrated into the Mac OS X way of things and crashes more often than I'd like, but I still use it every day to keep track of my finances, so it certainly comes under the list of things I couldn't do without.</li>
  <li><a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a>, an IRC client.  I don't use IRC that often these days, but when I do it's with colloquy.  It just works, really.  Tabbed windows let me keep up with multiple channels on multiple servers without taking up too much screen space.  It quietly lets me know if somebody's trying to get my attention.  It integrates into Mac OS X well.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Mail.app</a>, Apple's email client.  How can I mention all the essential pieces of Mac OS X software I use and <em>not</em> talk about Mail.app?  It runs on my laptop permanently, it's what I spend a large proportion of my day using.  It's sleek, fast, looks pretty.  A model application for Mac OS X, really.</li>
</ol>

Now I'm feeling that my next post should be 'Top 10 applications on my Mac that I should make better use of', since going through there I'm conscious of a few pieces of software I have installed, purchased, then never really used to their full potential...
