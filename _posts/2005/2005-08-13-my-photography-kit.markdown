    meta data to images. It&#8217;s awkward to add keywords in iPhoto (something which
    Keyword Assistant mitigates somewhat) and there&#8217;s insufficient access to
    meta data to append the kind of information I would like to apply to my images
    in a structured format. Add to that the fact that I&#8217;ve started to take my
    photography a little more &#8217;seriously&#8217;. I&#8217;ve got a shiny new
    camera and now I shoot in RAW format. Unfortunately, iPhoto doesn&#8217;t support
    the new Canon RAW (.CR2) format. And I&#8217;m unimpressed with iPhoto&#8217;s
    support for RAW images anyway. [...]'

This is what I have in the way of photography kit just now:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_350d/index.asp">Canon EOS 350D</a> (aka Digital Rebel XT) digital SLR camera.</li>
  <li>Canon <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/ef_lenses/zoom_lenses/ef-s_18-55mm_f-3.5-5.6/index.asp">EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM</a> lens (ie the default one that comes with the EOS 350D consumer kit).</li>
  <li>Canon <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/ef_lenses/zoom_lenses/ef_75300mm_f456iii_usm/index.asp">EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM</a> lens.</li>
  <li>Canon <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=141&modelid=7394">Speedlite 420EX</a> flash.</li>
  <li>A couple of Sandisk 512MB compact flash cards, one of which is <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/retail/cf.asp">dog slow</a>; the other is just a <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/retail/ultra2-cf.asp">bit slow</a>.</li>
  <li>A velbon mini tripod</li>
  <li>Jessops-own floor-standing tripod, which maxes out at about 5 feet high.</li>
  <li>A circular polarising filter.</li>
  <li>Spare batteries.</li>
  <li>A bag to put it all in!</li>
</ul>

That's about it for now...  At some point in the not too distant future, I'd like to add a 50mm f/1.8 lens to that arsenal for lower light/portrait work, and some more (faster!) compact flash cards so I can take more than 130 shots between refills.  Oh, and a macro lens of some variety would rock somewhat. :)

Software-wise, I'm kinda up in the air just now.  That's the post I was about to write, but I figured I should start this category properly, by mentioning what kit I'm using.  So maybe the next post will be more about the software...
