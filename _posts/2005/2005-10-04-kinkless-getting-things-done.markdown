  content: ! 'I did the same thing yesterday - downloaded KGTD, saw it needed Pro,
    finally made the Pro upgrade. I''ve been an OmniOutliner fan for years, and I
    think this is an amazing showcase of taking advantage of OO''s scriptability.
    For a while now, I''ve been looking at Tinderbox with some envy, because there
    are some great GTD toolkits available for it that take advantage of views and
    agents or whatever it is that Tinderbox has in its favor here. But the $175 price
    tag and very strange feeling UI have kept me back.


    KGTD''s ability to synchronize the project and actions list (and house other data)
    is good enough, I think.'

Today I've been having a quick play around with <a href="http://kinkless.com/articles/2005/10/04/kinkless-gtd-0-61-current">Kinkless GTD</a>, a Getting Things Done-like tool for <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">Omni Outliner</a>.  Unfortunately, it requires the professional edition, and I only own the standard edition, but I took the plunge and decided to pay the $29.95 for the upgrade.  Hey, it gives me the ability to record memos to myself too, so that's worth it all by itself, right? :-)  I've just been playing around with the default template so far, synchronising things, marking items as complete, seeing that it always picks me a next action for each project automatically.  If I can get into pushing all my to do lists onto Omni Outliner (something I've been intending to do anyway), I think this will seriously rock.

But I still have to block off some time to myself to actually sort out those big lists of stuff to do that are kicking around in my head (and in a few Omni Outliner documents, and on my whiteboard at work, and on the pad of paper neat to me at work, and in my Moleskine I carry around, and on bits of paper at home, and on the fridge at home, and ...!), into one neat place.
