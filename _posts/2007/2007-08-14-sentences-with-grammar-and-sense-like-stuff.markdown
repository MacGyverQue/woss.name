As I [ranted on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mathie/statuses/205173902) earlier this morning, I was reading a document from a rather large, well-established payment service provider talking about a massive, monolithic, upgrade they were about to undertake.  The documentation I was reading was about the potential impact on applications which use their service.  I'll quote a portion for you:

> The remote administration features continues however because the underlying architecture has changed the responses our system returns now be as follows.

It doesn't make any more sense in context, but revealing the context may reveal the offender. :-)  I'm interpreting it as:

> The remote administration features will continue to be supported as-is, however because the underlying architecture has changed, the responses our system return have been modified as follows:

Now I'm not particularly criticising the person who wrote the document; obviously their skills are specialised towards the technical end of the spectrum and that's perfectly reasonable.  Mine are too.  However, what's not acceptable is that a company let this out their door as being representative of the company.  Now I happen to know this particular company also produces several print publications and has a staff of editors.  In my humble opinion, *every* document that comes out of an organisation should be proofed for style, particularly if that organisation has the professional capability in-house!

OK, rant over.  I'll now allow you to pull apart this post, pointing out all the grammatical errors, in the comments. :-)
