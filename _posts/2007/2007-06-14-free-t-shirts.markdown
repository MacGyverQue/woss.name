    one of these when they send us more stuff. Hopefully we'll not get any baseball
    caps ;-).<&#47;p>

Well, for me, at least. :-)  After I mentioned my [experiences with Splunk](http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;2007&#47;06&#47;03&#47;splunking-your-logs&#47;) recently, a couple of [Splunk's](http:&#47;&#47;www.splunk.com&#47;) folks got in touch with me by email, asking for my address.  No, it wasn't because they were going to send round "the boys" to teach me better ways of submitting bugs reports, it was to send me a t-shirt.  A parcel arrived for me yesterday morning containing not just one, but two t-shirts, all the way from Splunk HQ in San Fransisco!

So, I'd just like to say two things:  first of all, thank you very much for the lovely t-shirts, Splunk!

Secondly, my wardrobe could do with a refresh.  Does anybody else want to send me t-shirts? (I'm an XL, and you can [easily figure out my address](http:&#47;&#47;www.rubaidh.com&#47;company&#47;contact).)  I'd really love an [OpenSolaris](http:&#47;&#47;www.opensolaris.org&#47;) one, for example... :-)
