Looking at some other projects, I realise the major thing that [MailManager](http://www.logicalware.com/) is missing is snazzy release names.  In the world of [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), we have releases named after characters in [Toy Story](http://imdb.com/title/tt0114709/) -- hamm, slink, potato, woody, sarge and now etch.  [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) has big cats -- Tiger, Panther, Jaguar -- and the next in line is suggested as [Liger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger) in the blogging world.

So, what theme should the [MailManager](http://www.logicalware.com/) releases have?  I'm thinking beer or pub names, but it has to have <em>some</em> sort of International appeal, and it probably wouldn't be a great idea to infringe other people's copyright or trademarks.  So what do you think?
