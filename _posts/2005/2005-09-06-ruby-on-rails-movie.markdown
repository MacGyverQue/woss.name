I've finally gotten around to watching the [intro movie](http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov) (50MB!) for [Ruby On Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/).  Wow.  There's nothing like a quick example to show you how powerful Rails can be.  In the <em>15 minute</em> video, they build a blog, complete with a comment system.  15 minutes, and there's already something to show the customer!  That's agile!  And I can see how the popularity of [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) has been driven by the very same demonstration.  (I also see somebody else uses an alias for it from the command line which isn't <code>tm</code>!)

It's also reminded me that, as a company, we should look at how [37 Signals](http://37signals.com)' business model works and what's driving their success.  By the sounds of it, we're in <em>exactly</em> the same position (though with fewer products in our portfolio, the product itself being open source and a reliance on the less cool [Zope](http://zope.org/)).  It's still the same subscription model though, the target market is <em>very</em> similar and I think it's actually complementary to their suite.

This probably isn't the time to mention that I've been vaguely plotting/hacking MailManagerOnRails in my spare time, is it? :-)
