I gather that Annabel and her mum are off to Barcelona at the last weekend of November for a 'hen weekend'...  So if anybody was happening to want to organise something something similar, that weekend would be particularly apropos, and maybe you want to direct suggestions to <a href="http://www.drossy.net/blog/ rel="friend">Derek</a>. :-)
