Annabel, John and I are heading off to Coll (a small island off the west coast of Scotland) for a week, leaving on Saturday.  I've checked already, and apparently the hotel on the island has a wifi hotspot, so I will still have access to the Internet and the ability to honour my 24x7 support contracts, but other than that I fully intend this to be a holiday away from the computer, away from software development.  I'm planning on spending most of the time behind a lens (the bottom of a pint glass is a lens of sorts too, isn't it? :-) ) practising my photographic technique.

In particular, there is an abundance of nesting seabirds at this time of year.  In fact, that is John's main interest: counting the seabird population on Coll.  He's been visiting the island sporadically since 1969, doing bird counts and submitting the data to the [Nature Conservancy Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Conservancy_Council) (now [Scottish Natural Heritage](http://www.snh.org.uk/) in Scotland).  In particular, he's interested in:

* Little tern, common tern & arctic tern.
* Black-headed gull, common gull, great black-backed gull (not important)
* Lesser black-backed gull, herring gull (these are his main interest).
* Arctic skua.

I think it'll be difficult for me to get away from the island without getting a few photographs of these, since we'll be counting them.  But there's lots of other interesting creatures we should be able to find, like red-throated divers, corncrakes, oystercatchers and lapwings.  I hear rumours that there are even some peregrines and osprey around.  The island also has lots of other wildlife, like otters &amp; perhaps even dolphins &amp; basking sharks in the nearby waters.

Can you tell I'm really not a nature-type person at all, I just think stuff looks pretty and wants photographed?  John and Annabel are the experts, which is why I let them tag along. :-)
