Alan Francis and I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2008</a> in Florida.  We did a slightly newer take on Alan and Paul's talk from RailsConf Europe 2008 entitled, "Ruby with an Accent: Organising a Regional Conference", all about our experiences of organising and running <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/">Scotland on Rails</a>.

Anyway, the lovely folks at Confreaks recorded the entire conference and have now uploaded the talks.  You can find our talk here: <a href="http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/organizing-a-regional-conference.html">Ruby with an Accent: Organising a regional conference</a>.  It's definitely not my best performance ever (where did that accent come from?!), but the content is pretty useful.

In other news, registration for Scotland on Rails is now open.  You can pick up an early bird ticket for just &pound;150 (which is about $230) until 8th February.  So, run, don't walk, to the <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/registration">registration page</a> to book your place now!  I mean, can you afford to miss out on seeing Jim Weirich, Michael Feathers, Dave Thomas, Yehuda Katz and Marcel Molina Jr in Edinburgh this March?  It's going to be an awesome weekend!<br/>
