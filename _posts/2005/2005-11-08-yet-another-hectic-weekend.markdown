Well, we now have wedding rings, we now have a marriage license in process.  We've sent out about 70 of the wedding invitations.  And my bit of it is lagging slightly: the online RSVP system.  I took a couple of half-days off work this week and I've finally gotten it just about cracked though -- a couple more tweaks tonight and it'll be ready to go live!  Woo!  Keep an eye on <a href="http://wedding.mathieson.name/">http://wedding.mathieson.name/</a> for the full functionality to be unveiled!

There's lots more happening in the background than most people will be able to see -- that's how we've created the guest list and all the invitation information too.  It will also shortly be providing us with functionality to create table layouts.  RSVP handling really is just the tip of the iceberg.  I think I can now officially say I've used <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> in anger, and I'm still really loving it!

Oh, and should you be so inclined, you can now <a href="https://www.johnlewisgiftlist.com/giftint/guestpassword?giftlistnum=155724">buy us wedding presents</a>!  Or even just laugh at the ridiculous stuff we've put up there. :-)  We got a little bit carried away in kitchenware, but I've <em>always</em> wanted a set of <a href="http://www.lecreuset.co.uk/">Le Creuset</a> pots and some decent chef's knives.  Yes, Derek, you're right, I can be a geek about <em>anything</em>, even cooking. :-)
