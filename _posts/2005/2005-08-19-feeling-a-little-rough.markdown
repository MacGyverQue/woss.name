There was a young man who swallowed pint one
Just the one, after work was done
Perhaps he'll die

There was a young man who swallowed pint two
He drank pint two, then nipped to the loo
He swallowed pint two to join pint one
Just the one, after work was done
Perhaps he'll die

There was a young man who swallowed pint three
Which turned up for free, 'nother round from Pete
He swallowed pint three to join pint two
He swallowed pint two to join pint one
Just the one, after work was done
Perhaps he'll die

There was a young man who swallowed pint four
Just one more, then out the door
He swallowed pint four to join pint three
He swallowed pint three to join pint two
He swallowed pint two to join pint one
Just the one, after work was done
Perhaps he'll die

There was a young man who swallowed pint five
Others leave after five, but he's still alive
He swallowed pint five to join pint four
He swallowed pint four to join pint three
He swallowed pint three to join pint two
He swallowed pint two to join pint one
Just the one, after work was done
Perhaps he'll die

There was a young man who swallowed pint six
He'd had no food, even a bag of crips!
He swallowed pint six to join pint five
He swallowed pint five to join pint four
He swallowed pint four to join pint three
He swallowed pint three to join pint two
He swallowed pint two to join pint one
Just the one, after work was done
Perhaps he'll die

There was a young man who woke up in the morning
He's hungover of course!

I should really be brave, get out of bed and go to work.  After all, I'm sure everybody else is feeling just as bad as me...
