  content: <p>Yes, those things are best kept in a server room or closet. For home
    use I have a Buffalo Terastation which gives me 4x250Gb as a raid 5 array all
    in a 2 ft cube. The lust for the thumper box is a bit impractical for home :-)</p>

  content: ! '<p>The Terastation is, by most metrics and reviews, crap.  What you
    and Bray want is an Infrant ReadyNAS NV (see http://www.infrant.com).  It doesn''t
    run Solaris, but it does run on a SPARC, and it''s small and quiet enough to forget
    it''s there.</p>


    <p>What I thought was surprising about the Databox post was the low storage volume
    Bray suggests.  A half-terabyte over ten cheap disks?  I spent less than a grand
    on four SATA disks and the ReadyNAS itself and I already have just under a terabyte
    in RAID5.</p>'

  content: ! '<p>It''s so simple to put together an x86 based server with massive
    potential for growth, and initial cost will be quite competitive with a ReadyNAS,
    I''d say. Also, you get a full-fledged server, not just a NAS solution.</p>


    <p>Just buy a really big PC server case, something like this perhaps: http://www.tricod.de/index.php?id=74#
    - it can be had for a few hundred euroes including dual 400 watt power supplies.
    Then mount a PC motherboard with CPU, memory, integrated graphics and integrated
    gigabit ports in it, buy add-on cards for more SATA connectors, a few hot-swap
    enclosures that fit in the 11 exposed 5.25 inch drive slots and then start out
    with five drives (2 x ufs for the boot mirror, 3 x ZFS for a RAID-Z.</p>


    <p>Presto, a terabyte of storage with an easy upgrade path to several times that
    in one machine, and it''s a full fledged Solaris 10 x86 server that you can use
    for all kinds of fun stuff.</p>


    <p>Sure, it''s more fiddly than a plug-in-and-forget ReadyNAS but it''s also more
    capable.</p>'

  content: <p>I got a Terastation pretty cheap and so far it is way more reliable
    than any NAS i have tried before (anyone got a spare network card for a SnapServer?).
    But I'll take a look at the one you suggest, thanks.</p>

Yeah, I want a [Databox](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/12/Home-Storage).  Actually, like [Simon](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=love_at_tera_byte), really I want a [Thumper](http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4500/), but after my experiences with the T2000, I think I'd be made to switch it off at night lest the neighbours complain about the noise.  Again.
