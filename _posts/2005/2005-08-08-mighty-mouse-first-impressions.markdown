  content: ! '[...] Well, I&#8217;ve been using the Mighty Mouse for just over a week
    now. I thought it might be time to write up some more impressions of it. Though
    perhaps this isn&#8217;t a good time, since it&#8217;s really bugging me just
    now! That which I described as &#8216;neat&#8217; in the previous article &#8212;
    that if you whisk the scroll ball to the left, it will jump back in your browser
    history? Freakin&#8217; annoying! Say, for example, you&#8217;ve just written
    a massive big post in the Wordpress &#8216;write post&#8217; window, but the &#8216;Save&#8217;
    button is just out of your current screen view. So you go to the scroll ball to
    move down the page a little and click on the button. Only you accidentally click
    it to the left slightly. Bye bye post! That behaviour will have to go. (Ooh, I
    might have found the solution, in the last comment of this review. I guess I&#8217;ll
    have to restart Firefox to find out, though, and I&#8217;d like to finish this
    psot first!) [...]'

My <a href="http://woss.name/2005/08/03/re-mighty-mouse/" title="Re: Mighty Mouse">Mighty Mouse</a> has arrived this morning!  I've plugged it in, installed the drivers (which only work with Mac OS X 10.4.2+ -- for anything else, it just behaves like a standard scroll-wheel mouse) and set it up.  The mouse 'buttons' are odd.  Really it still feels like a single button, but the action it performs depends upon where on the shell you push.  Very bizarre.  So far, I've assigned the left and right buttons to their usual role, the middle button to bring up the Dashboard and the side button to bring up Expos&eacute; (which is pretty much the default).  I'll probably find a better use for the latter two later...  The scroll ball is neat - very sensitive, doesn't take much movement to scroll, but you can just feel it click as it moves, which I really like as a feedback mechanism.  I haven't tried the horizontal scrolling feature yet, since I've only been catching up with my email and what's been happening on <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~mathie/friends/" title="Graeme's friends on LJ">LJ</a>.  I think a bit of playing around with photographs in Photoshop is called for at some point today.  Just for testing purposes you understand.

Ooh, I've just discovered something <em>really</em> neat.  If you whisk the scroll ball to the left while you're in a web browser (certainly works with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox" title="Get Firefox!">Firefox</a>), it acts like the back button.  And likewise with spinning it right acting like forward.  Of course, I need to <em>not</em> do that accidentally or I'd be likely to lose all these words...
