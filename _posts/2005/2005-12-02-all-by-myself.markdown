I'm all alone in the office today.  Andy's down in London for a couple of sales meetings, Kev's off to a music festival (Butlins-style, which sounds far more civilised!) for the weekend and Clare's waiting at home for a carpet fitter to turn up.  Which means I've spent the past twenty minutes trying to un-hide the speakers so I can listen to some music of my own without headphones (mmm, Nine Inch Nails - With Teeth).  It was tempting to spend all day watching DVDs on the LCD projector, but some spoilsport took it away with him for doing presentations!  And while Warcraft III is on the laptop and is calling me, I will resist the temptation!  Anyway, I've promised OI that I'll deploy their new contacts directory by mid-day, so I should get a move on...

After I've made a pot of coffee. :-)
