For the first time in my life, I have bought music online (in a downloadable format; I've bought CDs from Amazon before...).  I was introduced to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.allofmp3.com&#47;">AllOfMP3<&#47;a> by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.livejournal.com&#47;users&#47;broonie&#47;">Broonie<&#47;a> (who learned about it from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.livejournal.com&#47;users&#47;render&#47;">Render<&#47;a>) this morning and decided to give it a whirl.  It's <em>incredibly<&#47;em> cheap -- tracks are charged by the bandwidth consumed downloading them and so far I'm averaging $0.12 per track!  So I loaded my account up with $10 (less than &pound;6) and have managed to acquire:

<ul>
  <li>Devin Townsend -- Ocean Machine<&#47;li>
  <li>Depeche Mode -- Playing The Angel<&#47;li>
  <li>Franz Ferdinand -- You Could Have It So Much Better<&#47;li>
  <li>Kaiser Chiefs -- Employment<&#47;li>
  <li>New Order -- Singles (which I'm currently listening to)<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

Not bad for a morning's haul.  The speed downloading stuff is exceptionally good -- I was saturating my 2Mb&#47;s before heading to work, and whatever work's connection was afterwards. :-)  I suspect I'll be spending a few more bucks there sometime soon...
