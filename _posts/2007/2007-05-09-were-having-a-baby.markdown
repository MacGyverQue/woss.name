It's because I've had some really exciting news that I've been dying to tell everyone, but I was sworn to secrecy.  We're going to have a baby!  How exciting is that?!?<br &#47;>
<br &#47;>
Annabel went along for the first scan today (there are two versions up on Flickr so click on through to see the other) and judging by the measurements, she's 13 weeks & 1 day pregnant, meaning the baby's due date is 13th November, a mere 188 days away!<br &#47;>
<br &#47;>
Anyway, I'll try not to bore you too much here on [Notes from a Messy Desk](http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;) and return to my regular scheduled content, but for anybody who's interested, we should both be starting to blog on [Wellie Monster](http:&#47;&#47;welliemonster.com&#47;), leading up to the arrival of the sprog, and beyond.
