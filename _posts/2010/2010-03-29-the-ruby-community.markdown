<p>Most of you will already know that I am part of the triumvirate who runs the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;scottishrubyconference.com&#47;">Scottish Ruby Conference<&#47;a> (n&eacute;e Scotland on Rails) each year in Edinburgh. We've just wrapped up this year's conference and it has been utterly awesome. I may write more about that later, but that's not where I'm going today.<&#47;p>
<p>On the Saturday morning, I turned up, feeling the last whisky from the night before wasn't such a great idea as it seemed at the time. Noticing that the battery was very low, I plugged my iPhone into my laptop, which was behind the registration desk, then disappeared off with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.markconnell.co.uk&#47;">Mark<&#47;a> to eat the breakfasts we'd acquired from Greggs on the way in. From there, we headed straight in to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tbray.org&#47;ongoing&#47;">Tim Bray<&#47;a>'s keynote (by the second morning, the conference practically runs itself!). Afterwards, I popped out to pick up my phone, knowing it would have been recharged by then.<&#47;p>
<p>Except it wasn't there.<&#47;p>
<p>At first, I figured one of my fellow organisers had thought, "leaving a phone lying around is a stupid thing to do, anybody could steal it!" and pocketed it for safe keeping. A quick check discovered that wasn't the case.<&#47;p>
<p>I logged in to MobileMe, and hit the "Find my iPhone" button. It had been switched off. That's a little suspicious, because it was switched on and charging when I left it. I sent a message to the phone so that it would say, "This is @mathie's iPhone. Please could you drop it off at the registration desk when you find it?" When MobileMe does that, it sends an email to the phone's owner when the message has successfully been delivered. As of Monday evening I still haven't received that message. Which means it's still switched off, or the SIM has been removed.<&#47;p>
<p>So I've lost my iPhone. That's sad. What's worse is that I can't help feeling it was probably one of our delegates (ie one of the Ruby community) who stole it. That really hurts.<&#47;p>
<p>Without a mobile phone, I didn't see much of Twitter on Saturday or Sunday. After my family picked me up from the hotel on Sunday, we went shopping with the express purpose of finding a new iPhone. Turns out I really rely on the device for lots of things. It took a while because O2 seem to be renovating most of their Edinburgh stores. Still, third time lucky, and &pound;570 poorer.<&#47;p>
<p>Then I get home and find this:&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;pledgie.com&#47;campaigns&#47;9721">Support @mathie and say thank you<&#47;a>. Joe O'Brien, a friend I met through the first Scotland on Rails, had set up a Pledgie to encourage the conference attendees to help me cover the cost of replacing the iPhone. And by that point on Sunday evening, I was nearly half way towards what I'd just paid to replace it!<&#47;p>
<p>I cannot believe how kind people in the Ruby community can be! It's just incredible, and I'm really touched. And that's definitely the way I'm going to look back on this affair. There may be one or two bad apples in there but the Ruby community as a whole is ... I can't think of one word to described it. Awesome. Incredible. Generous. Kind.<&#47;p>
<p>I came to the Ruby community because of Rails. I'm definitely going to stay as a part of the Ruby community because of the people. Thank you, all.<&#47;p>
