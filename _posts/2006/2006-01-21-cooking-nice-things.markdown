  content: ! '<p>I LOVE hot foods just like Mathie, but they don''t always agree with
    my stomach.  I''m also allergic to nuts and your use of sunflower oil seems like
    a great idea, not only for this recipe, but for others of the same genre.  Now
    that I think of it, I think I should do some experimenting!</p>


    <p>That''s great that one of your goals is to cook "nice dinners".  It can be
    tough when you have so many things packed in the day.  But, it''s one of my goals,
    too.  And, I do enjoy cooking.  You should join us over at the <a href="http://www.chefclub.net"

    <p>Keep up the great entertainment</p>

Well, at least one of my New Year not-Resolutions has lasted reasonably well so far: cooking nice food for dinner.  Tonight's is about five minutes from being done, and is another from [Nigel Slater's Kitchen Diaries](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007199481/mathieoftheen-21) (which is basically a cook's blog, in print): A curry of Aubergines, Tomatoes and Lemon Grass.  Without the lemon grass, unfortunately, since we don't have any.  I suspect it's going to be a little spicy for Annabel's taste (having just tested it myself) but it smells heavenly and I'm sure I'll enjoy it. :-)

It's a Thai-like dish, where I whizzed up some garlic, ginger, chilli peppers and half an onion up in the blender with a bit of fish sauce.  That was fried up for a few minutes in lots of sunflower oil (the recipe calls for ground nut oil, but we don't do nuts 'round here, even if I do have an Epipen now!) along with some mushrooms.  Add in vegetable stock, then a big pile of tomatoes and the aubergine.  Simmer for 15 minutes, then add in some coconut milk and simmer for a few more minutes.  It goes perfectly with some Basmati rice.

**Update** Yeah, it was a bit on the spicy side for Annabel, so I added some extra coconut milk to her portion.  'twas perfect for me, though. :-)
