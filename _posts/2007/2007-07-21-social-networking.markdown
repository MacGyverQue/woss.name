I seem to have been sucked into [Facebook](http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;).  I don't know quite what it is, but it does seem to be addictive.  My theory is that it's the news feed, telling you what new things your friends are up to and who&#47;what they've discovered on the site, which allows you to discover new things too.  That's definitely a concept I'll be incorporating into a couple of web apps I'm currently working on. :-)

Anyway, you can find my Facebook profile here: [Graeme Mathieson's Facebook Profile](http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;profile.php?id=500870819).  And for business networking, you can find my LinkedIn profile here: [Graeme Mathieson's LinkedIn profile](http:&#47;&#47;www.linkedin.com&#47;in&#47;mathie).  Feel free to connect to me on either if you feel you know me.
