I've finally gotten around to watching the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rubyonrails.com&#47;media&#47;video&#47;rails_take2_with_sound.mov">intro movie<&#47;a> (50MB!) for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rubyonrails.com&#47;">Ruby On Rails<&#47;a>.  Wow.  There's nothing like a quick example to show you how powerful Rails can be.  In the <em>15 minute<&#47;em> video, they build a blog, complete with a comment system.  15 minutes, and there's already something to show the customer!  That's agile!  And I can see how the popularity of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;macromates.com&#47;">TextMate<&#47;a> has been driven by the very same demonstration.  (I also see somebody else uses an alias for it from the command line which isn't <code>tm<&#47;code>!)

It's also reminded me that, as a company, we should look at how <a href="http:&#47;&#47;37signals.com">37 Signals<&#47;a>' business model works and what's driving their success.  By the sounds of it, we're in <em>exactly<&#47;em> the same position (though with fewer products in our portfolio, the product itself being open source and a reliance on the less cool <a href="http:&#47;&#47;zope.org&#47;">Zope<&#47;a>).  It's still the same subscription model though, the target market is <em>very<&#47;em> similar and I think it's actually complementary to their suite.

This probably isn't the time to mention that I've been vaguely plotting&#47;hacking MailManagerOnRails in my spare time, is it? :-)
