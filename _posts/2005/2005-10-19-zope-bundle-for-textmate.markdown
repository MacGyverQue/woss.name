I decided to scratch an itch this morning, since I've been working with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.plope.com&#47;Books&#47;2_7Edition&#47;RelationalDatabases.stx#1-8">ZSQL methods<&#47;a> in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.macromates.com&#47;">TextMate<&#47;a> quite a lot recently.  So I've created a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;wp-content&#47;Zope.tmbundle.tar.gz">Zope bundle<&#47;a> with some syntax highlighting support.  It will do basic highlighting of plain DTML pages, and highlight both the DTML and SQL bits of ZSQL methods.  It's not particularly useful yet, but it does enough for me.  I'm planning to improve the highlighting at some point, add in ZPT support (though that pretty much works with XHTML highlighting so far...) and push in some snippets.
