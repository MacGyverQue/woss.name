OK, so nobody else seems to care as far as I can see from wading through my feeds since the WWDC keynote, but the most exciting feature I noticed was buried at the bottom of the [preview of xcode 3.0](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/xcode.html):

> Many such Xray instruments leverage the open source DTrace, now built into Mac OS X Leopard.

They've incorporated [DTrace](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/) into Mac OS X!  Perhaps I'm biased because I've been following Solaris development a bit lately, but this is really exciting news.  DTrace seems to me (I've never actually used it, just read other people's experiences) to be a fantastic tool for debugging and profiling both development and production systems.  I'm really looking forward to using it (for example, [dtrace on rails](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc?entry=dtrace_on_rails)).

But that's not what I'm getting really excited about.  I'm getting really excited about something that was hinted a while ago and hasn't, as far as I can see, been mentioned.  Something else from the same open source codebase that would suit being integrated into Mac OS X.  [ZFS](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/)!
