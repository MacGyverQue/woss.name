I've decided to try out [Campaign Monitor](http:&#47;&#47;www.campaignmonitor.com&#47;) in an attempt to have a closer relationship with the clients of my company, [Rubaidh Ltd](http:&#47;&#47;www.rubaidh.com&#47;).  So far, I haven't actually composed a newsletter -- hopefully that'll be a task for this weekend, alongside updating a web site that hasn't seen any care and attention for a few months -- but I'm collecting subscribers.  In order to subscribe, fill out this wee form:

<form action="http:&#47;&#47;rubaidhltd.cmail1.com&#47;.aspx&#47;s&#47;114317&#47;" method="post">
<div>
<label for="name">Name:<&#47;label><br &#47;><input type="text" name="name" id="name" &#47;><br &#47;>
<label for="l114317-114317">Email:<&#47;label><br &#47;><input type="text" name="cm-114317-114317" id="l114317-114317" &#47;><br &#47;>
<input type="submit" value="Subscribe" &#47;>
<&#47;div>
<&#47;form>

I promise I won't use your email address for any sort of nefarious purposes (I hate spam too!) and there won't be a massive volume of email -- I'd estimate it'll start at one a month and tail off to 'whenever I remember'.
