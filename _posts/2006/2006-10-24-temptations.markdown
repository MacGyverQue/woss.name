Apple is tempting me, again, with two shiny new things.  First is the [Leopard Early Start Kit](http://developer.apple.com/leopard/) which will get me the latest preview of the next version of Mac OS X (10.5).  In order to obtain it, I have to be an Apple Developer Connection Premier or Select member.  Now, while the Premier membership costs $3,500, the Select one is a mere $500.  For that, I'll get the early start kit, the release when it comes out, and discount on my next bit of Apple hardware.  Aye, there's lots of other bits and pieces from it, but none that I'm likely to take advantage of.  So, is it worth $500 to get Leopard nearly 6 months before you do?  And would I be able to keep my mouth shut enough to not have Apple lawyers waving NDAs in my face? :-)

Of course, I know what I'd be using the hardware discount for:  the [MacBook Pros](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) have been rev'd to Intel Core 2 Duos.  Oww, they sound fast.  Want.  Want.  Donations via Paypal to [mathie@woss.name](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=mathie%40woss%2ename&no_shipping=2&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=GBP&lc=GB&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8) gratefully accepted. :-)
