    I''m just trying to remember exactly when all that studying maths happened?'

<p>OK, this isn't supposed to be a diary.  It's more like notes to remind me of stuff to blog about later.  Right now, we're sitting on the <em>Blue Star Paros</em>, waiting for it to leave Piraeus, our eventual destination: Naxos.  We're sitting in 'Oik' class (yes, that really is what it says on the tickets!) at the stern of the boat, looking back over the harbour &ellipse; and we've just left!  There goes our theory that they forgot to untie the boat and we've been dragging the town along behind us for the past 10 miles! :-) </p>

      <p>Today has been a very relaxed journey, really.</p>

      <p><em>Time passes...</em></p>

      <p>OK I've just been taking lots of pictures as we left port.  And finishing a lovely Mythos beer. :-)  I think I've managed to pick up a couple of shots of the Parthenon &amp; Mt Olympus -- we'll see how well they turn out.</p>

      <p>Anyway, the journey started at 03:15 with mum giving us a lift to Glasgow Airport.  We arrived well before check-in opened at 04:00, but already the queue was snaking well beyond the depth of the check-in area!  Other than spending too much at WH Smiths -- Irn Bru (my last for 10 days!), jelly babies, fruit pastilles, sudoku puzzle books and this month's Practical Photography -- nothing much happened at the airport.  We left on schedule at 06:00.</p>

      <p>I read <q>Let It Bleed</q> for part of the flight, caught up on my sleep and read the entire contents of Practical Photography cover-to-cover.  I did a couple of sudoku puzzles, but got annoyed with myself for fluffing up an easy one, so stopped and carried on reading.  Annabel was sat next to the window &amp; we were sat over the wing, so most of the ground, well, just passed us by. :-/  We saw some forest area that we figured was probably part of Germany, then the tail end of the Alps, and the Adriatic Sea as we headed down the Croatian (or would it be something else?  some part of the ex-Yugoslavia anyway!) coast.  It was a bumpy arrival at 12:00 local time (10:00 BST).</p>

      <p>After picking up our bags, we had a Greek Coffee (by accident I wound up having one with sugar -- metria -- rather than without -- sketo -- but it was very nice!) then headed to the bus for Piraeus.  The <q>X96</q> takes you straight from the airport to the harbour in about an hour and a half.  After buying ferry tickets to Naxos -- the <em>Blue Star Paros</em>, leaving at 17:30, arriving at 22:30, going via Paros, costs &euro;23.20 one way -- we figured we deserved a beer.  Which was supplemented by two bottles of Retsina (a local wine which I'll probably describe in more detail later!) and a lunch of meat &amp; cheese.  The cheese salad was particularly good.  Another Greek coffee (sans sucre this time) and we headed for the boat.  And so here we are.  It's another few hours 'til we'll hit Naxos, so I think some more sleep catching up is required.</p>

      <p>Things I've learned today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Greek character set is different and I'm now glad of studying all that maths at University.</li>
        <li>Holding out your hand, palm facing outwards, is considered a rude gesture in Greece.</li>
        <li>You don't flush paper (eg toilet paper, sanitary towels) down the loo.  There's a bin beside every toilet for that kind of thing.</li>
        <li>Mythos is a really nice local lager.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Firsts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First time I've been to Greece.</li>
        <li>Furthest East I've ever travelled.</li>
        <li>This is the longest holiday I will have had in over 10 years.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ooh, John's been examining his sea life book, and apparently there might be phosphorescent beasties in the ship's wake at this time of year.  I shall have to prepare the tripod at the stern of the boat for after dark...  Time to go suss out sunset shots, in fact! :-)</p>
