  content: ! '<p>Ahh, I meant to mention the differences.  There are actually two
    methods of measuring ISO film speed, one is based on preserving highlights and
    the other on keeping mid gray (the grey card) at a central signal level.  If you
    are interested in the maths, I probably have a copy of the actual spec somewhere.<&#47;p>


    <p>It seems Canon have chosen to underrate their ISO film ratings in Camera -
    i.e. the camera is more sensitive than the quoted film speed.  See http:&#47;&#47;www.dpreview.com&#47;reviews&#47;canoneos5d&#47;page21.asp<&#47;p>


    <p>This means the light meter will read a little high.  Technically, this is better
    for your images, particularly if shooting in raw as it uses the bit range of the
    camera better.  Just make sure that the flashing highlights on the histogram don''t
    appear. If they do, the data has clipped and you have lost highlight detail (well,
    almost as raw has a few extra bits and may not have clipped thus in some situations
    you can recover from this - you just don''t know as the histogram is based upon
    the jpeg).<&#47;p>


    <p>If you start to clip, try setting the ISO on the meter a little higher if it
    adjusts in small steps or use the compensation option on the meter to dial in
    1&#47;3 to 2&#47;3 under exposure.<&#47;p>


    <p>For more discussion on this expose right theory, see the tutorial here: http:&#47;&#47;www.luminous-landscape.com&#47;tutorials&#47;expose-right.shtml<&#47;p>


    <p>I think Canon have some flag in their exposure algorithm to aim for the right
    of the histogram if they have a wide dynamic range in the scene.  A grey card
    has almost no dynamic range as it is of a single brightness and thus the camera
    will try to center the exposure.  This would be consistent with the extra sensitivity
    such that both a lightmeter reading and a camera exposure (where there is a wide
    range of tones) would be pushed towards the right of the histogram<&#47;p>'

I rediscovered [Apocalyptica](http:&#47;&#47;www.apocalyptica.com&#47;home&#47;) again this morning, while shopping for some new music online.  I seem to recall [broonie](http:&#47;&#47;www.sirena.org.uk&#47;log&#47;) loaning me one of their albums a few years back, but I'd completely forgotten they existed.  They are probably best known for [Metallica by Four Cellos](http:&#47;&#47;www.apocalyptica.com&#47;releases&#47;metallica.php).  It just so happens that I think the cello is the most beautiful sounding instrument in the world ever, so I'm having a fun morning listening to [Amplified](http:&#47;&#47;www.apocalyptica.com&#47;releases&#47;amplified.php), their new best-of (currently listening to a really neat version of Hall of the Mountain King).

In other news, Tim Kerby has kindly loaned me a [Gossen](http:&#47;&#47;www.gossen-photo.de&#47;english&#47;) Spot-Master light meter.  I've had a quick test of it this morning and I think I've figured out how it works, though it does seem to wind up +2&#47;3 Ev compared to my camera's TTL meter (measured against filling the frames with an 18% grey card in direct sunlight).  I wonder if that's something I ought to bear in mind when transferring readings from the light meter to the camera (and if so, why the difference?), or whether I'm doing something wrong...

Anyway, less of these distractions.  Back to work for me!
