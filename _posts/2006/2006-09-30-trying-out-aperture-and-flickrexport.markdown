I've just grabbed a random photo from my collection (aww, aren't they sweet?) and uploaded it with [FlickrExport for Aperture](http:&#47;&#47;connectedflow.com&#47;flickrexport&#47;aperture&#47;).  *Sooo* easy!  It automatically takes my keywords from Aperture, turning them into tags.  In fact, it also picks up other IPTC metadata (location, I've noticed so far) and sets tags for them too.

I see a license for FlickrExport and a Flickr pro account appearing on my bank statement in the very near future...

**update** Well, that's the Flickr Pro account taken care of.  At the current exchange rate, it works out at about &pound;1 per month for being able to upload 2GB of new photos every month and 'unlimited' storage.  Nice.
