Well, at least one of my New Year not-Resolutions has lasted reasonably well so far: cooking nice food for dinner.  Tonight's is about five minutes from being done, and is another from [Nigel Slater's Kitchen Diaries](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007199481/mathieoftheen-21) (which is basically a cook's blog, in print): A curry of Aubergines, Tomatoes and Lemon Grass.  Without the lemon grass, unfortunately, since we don't have any.  I suspect it's going to be a little spicy for Annabel's taste (having just tested it myself) but it smells heavenly and I'm sure I'll enjoy it. :-)

It's a Thai-like dish, where I whizzed up some garlic, ginger, chilli peppers and half an onion up in the blender with a bit of fish sauce.  That was fried up for a few minutes in lots of sunflower oil (the recipe calls for ground nut oil, but we don't do nuts 'round here, even if I do have an Epipen now!) along with some mushrooms.  Add in vegetable stock, then a big pile of tomatoes and the aubergine.  Simmer for 15 minutes, then add in some coconut milk and simmer for a few more minutes.  It goes perfectly with some Basmati rice.

**Update** Yeah, it was a bit on the spicy side for Annabel, so I added some extra coconut milk to her portion.  'twas perfect for me, though. :-)
