<p>As I mentioned at the tail end of last week, I presented [Ruby and Rails is Awesome](/2009/01/16/why-ruby-and-rails-is-awesome/) at the local Edinburgh [Tech Meetup](http://www.techmeetup.co.uk/).  The video of the presentation has just been uploaded to Vimeo, which you can watch right here:<br /><br /><object width="400" height="302"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2880527&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=660606&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2880527&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=660606&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="302"></embed></object><br /><br />Or you can see the [video of Why Ruby (and Rails) is Awesome](http://www.vimeo.com/2880527) at Vimeo if you're attempting to read this through a feed and the embedded version looked like tag soup. :-)<br /><br />I need to practice my presentation skills *a lot*.  Too many "errrrrrr"s and way too much time spent looking at the speaker notes on my laptop!</p>
