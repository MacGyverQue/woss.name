[Ethan](http:&#47;&#47;blackrimglasses.com&#47;) is running a series of blog articles about his 'so-called digital life' which makes interesting reading.  Normally I'd just bung these in my [del.icio.us](http:&#47;&#47;del.icio.us&#47;) feed to appear in a daily summary (and the sidebar), but they're way more exciting than that.  So:

 * [Part 1 - The environment](http:&#47;&#47;blackrimglasses.com&#47;archives&#47;2006&#47;01&#47;15&#47;my-so-called-digital-life-pt-1-the-environment&#47;)
 * [Part 2a - The Applications](http:&#47;&#47;blackrimglasses.com&#47;archives&#47;2006&#47;01&#47;18&#47;my-so-called-digital-life-pt-2-the-applications&#47;)
 * [Part 2b - The Applications](http:&#47;&#47;blackrimglasses.com&#47;archives&#47;2006&#47;01&#47;18&#47;my-so-called-digital-life-pt-2b-the-applications&#47;)

I'm tempted to do something similar...  Then again, I'd be listing most of the applications he's talked about so far ([TextMate](http:&#47;&#47;macromates.com&#47;), [NetNewsWire](http:&#47;&#47;ranchero.com&#47;netnewswire&#47;), [Firefox](http:&#47;&#47;www.mozilla.org&#47;products&#47;firefox&#47;), etc).

And more from the interesting-articles department: [Merlin Mann espousing the usefulness of Path Finder](http:&#47;&#47;www.43folders.com&#47;2006&#47;01&#47;17&#47;7-things-pathfinder&#47;).  I've now grabbed myself a copy of [Path Finder 4](http:&#47;&#47;www.cocoatech.com&#47;pf4&#47;) to try out though, since I don't touch the Finder much, I'm having trouble remembering it's there...
