The operation was a complete success with no sign of any nasty after-effects (the major risk with a parotidectomy is damage to the facial nerve which gives the appearance of having had a stroke and can be permanent!) and she's now at home, convalescing for the next couple of weeks.<br &#47;>
<br &#47;>
Here's one of the piccies I uploaded to Flickr showing off the cool scar!
