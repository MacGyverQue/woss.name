I just noticed an email in my inbox about a keysigning being held in Edinburgh, on 20th May (this Saturday) at 21:00.  The location is the lobby of the Radisson SAS Hotel, 80 High Street, The Royal Mile, Edinburgh, EH1 1TH ([map](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=eh1+1th&om=1)).  Have a look at the [original announcement](http://www.biglumber.com/x/web?ev=29615) for more details.  I'll endeavour to be there and to drag it off in the direction of a suitable pub (Holyrood Tavern, most likely) afterwards. :)

I'd forgotten all about [WWW 2006](http://www2006.org/) and it being in Edinburgh.  Though looking through the speaker list, it reads like the "Who's Who" of big, lumbering, dinosaur, Web 0.99 companies...
