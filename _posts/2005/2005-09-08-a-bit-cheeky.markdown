As part of our negotiations with the caterers for the wedding, I just asked:

<blockquote>
  <p>I take it there are no costs to us for you providing the bar?  I don't suppose we'd get some commission on bar sales? :-)  Knowing my mates, that'd pay for the meal by itself! :-)</p>
</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>
  <p>Personally, I think we can dispense with having two wine glasses and a water glass per person for the meal; if they want to drink both red and white wine, they can sloosh out their glass with a bit of water in between!  Would that make any difference to the cost?</p>
</blockquote>

And apparently, according to Annabel, <q>you're great at this!</q>  I thought I was just being silly...  It seems like we're quibbling over tiny details now that aren't actually going to make a significant difference to the cost, whereas what I actually want to say is <q>knock off the &pound;4+VAT corkage per guest and you've got yourself a deal.</q>  (Since we've got approximately 100 guests in total, that is a big deal!)  But I don't feel brave enough to try that...

That's another thing.  It's really bugging me that our catering company always quote their prices without VAT.  Now I realise that they also do corporate functions and deal with business customers a lot, so quoting prices excluding VAT is standard there.  But when you're dealing with <em>consumers</em> (ie the folks that have to pay VAT -- the likes of us!) wouldn't it be polite to give them an accurate cost up front?  In fact, weren't a bunch of computer-selling companies rapped over the knuckles for doing exactly the same thing a few years back?
