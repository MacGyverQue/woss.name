... for want of a better name. :)

The inaugural meeting of the Scottish Ruby User Group has been arranged!  We'll be meeting in [The Regent](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/17/17127/Regent/Edinburgh), 2 Montrose Terrace, Edinburgh on Thursday 25th May, from 19:00 onwards.  Chances are we'll be in the back room.

The Regent's a great pub, near enough to Waverley Station for non-Edinburgers, with free Wi-fi access and a lovely selection of beers, ciders, spirits and wine.  Orkney Dark Island is making a regular appearance on the pumps these days.

There's nothing formal arranged for this meeting; it's just a chance to get the ball rolling, see who's interested in Ruby around Scotland and to have a chat with a few beers.

To hear further announcements about Scottish Ruby User Group meetings, please subscribe to the [mailing list](http://lists.rubaidh.com/listinfo.cgi/scotruby-rubaidh.com).

I hope to see you there. :)
