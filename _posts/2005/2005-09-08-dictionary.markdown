  content: <p>I always have terrible trouble with comment-related plugins that require
    me to put some line in the comment loop; I can never seem to find the right spot.
    Can anyone tell me where I should put the php line in my comments loop? I haven
    not modified anything much, and I would be very grateful. Thanks!</p>

Note to self:

<blockquote>
<strong>celiac</strong> <em>|ËŒsiËlÉªak|</em> ( Brit. <strong>coeliac</strong>)
<dl>
<dt>adjective</dt>
<dd><ol>
	<li>Anatomy of or relating to the abdomen.</li>
        <li>Medicine of, relating to, or affected by celiac disease : a celiac child.</li>
</ol></dd>
<dt>noun</dt>
<dd><ol><li>a person with celiac disease.</li></ol></dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

as opposed to:

<blockquote>
<strong>celeriac</strong> <em>|sÉªËŒlÉ›rÉªak|</em>
<dl><dt>noun</dt>
<dd><ol><li>celery of a variety that forms a large swollen turniplike root that can be eaten cooked or raw.</li></ol></dd></dl>
</blockquote>

Hmm, is that a homophone, a homonym, or just me being stupid? :-)
