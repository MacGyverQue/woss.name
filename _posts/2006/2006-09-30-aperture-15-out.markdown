Along with a slew of other updates to support it, [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture) 1.5 has been released.  It's a free upgrade and seems to turn up after the 10.4.8 update has been installed and rebooted.

It has *just* finished upgrading my library (110 projects, just a shade over 10,000), having taken about an hour or so to migrate things, update projects, generate previews and validate everything.  That's on a quad G5 with 4.5GB of RAM -- I hate to think how long it would have taken on my laptop!

So the next task today is to play around with it, see what's new.  And to try out [FlickrExport for Aperture](http://www.connectedflow.com/blog/?p=42).  I've got a pile of photographs from Jon & April's wedding last week I've been saving 'til the update appeared so I'd have a proper project to try it out with.
