This time the assignment was:</p>

    To: Phil Phlashen
    Need mug of Pat Harwood for next issue of magazine.
    Might run w/some size.
    Deadline June 28, 23:59 GMT
    Ph: (000) 000-0000
    Please call to schedule

Unfortunately, I carelessly went to the pub last night and missed the deadline, but I figured I'd submit my attempt anyway, in the hope of some feedback.  My not-so-willing model was Annabel, since I didn't have a Pat Harwood handy.

We played around a bit with positioning the off-camera flash, mixing the combination of on- and off-camera flash.  I think this was the best combination of lighting and Annabel's expression (see [this example](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/177635408/) for a slightly different expression!).  I like the nice, close crop (no post-processing done!).  The light is, well, alright.  I got a nice catchlight in the eyes, but given more time I should have rearranged the off-camera flash more carefully to place the shadows better.  (For example, the shadow from the nose coming up her cheek to the right eye!)

Still, I like it, because it's a picture of my beautiful wife. :-)
