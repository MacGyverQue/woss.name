OK, so I'm starting to see <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jennandlucien.net&#47;lucien&#47;archives&#47;2005&#47;11&#47;aperture_mini_r.html">reviews<&#47;a> of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apple.com&#47;aperture&#47;">Aperture<&#47;a> from people that have received their copy.  And the web site even claims that it's now shipping.  But not to me, apparently:

<img src='http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;wp-content&#47;stillnoaperture.png' alt='Still not shipping Aperture' class="centered" &#47;>

So I still have to wait another week?  No fair!
