Yeah, I want a [Databox](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/12/Home-Storage).  Actually, like [Simon](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=love_at_tera_byte), really I want a [Thumper](http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4500/), but after my experiences with the T2000, I think I'd be made to switch it off at night lest the neighbours complain about the noise.  Again.
