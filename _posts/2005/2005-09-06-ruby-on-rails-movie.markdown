I've finally gotten around to watching the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov">intro movie</a> (50MB!) for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby On Rails</a>.  Wow.  There's nothing like a quick example to show you how powerful Rails can be.  In the <em>15 minute</em> video, they build a blog, complete with a comment system.  15 minutes, and there's already something to show the customer!  That's agile!  And I can see how the popularity of <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> has been driven by the very same demonstration.  (I also see somebody else uses an alias for it from the command line which isn't <code>tm</code>!)

It's also reminded me that, as a company, we should look at how <a href="http://37signals.com">37 Signals</a>' business model works and what's driving their success.  By the sounds of it, we're in <em>exactly</em> the same position (though with fewer products in our portfolio, the product itself being open source and a reliance on the less cool <a href="http://zope.org/">Zope</a>).  It's still the same subscription model though, the target market is <em>very</em> similar and I think it's actually complementary to their suite.

This probably isn't the time to mention that I've been vaguely plotting/hacking MailManagerOnRails in my spare time, is it? :-)
