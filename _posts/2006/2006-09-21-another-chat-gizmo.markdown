Since you can never have enough IM/phone clients on enough networks, I've now
signed up for [Gizmo](http://www.gizmoproject.com/). I'm `mathie_wossname`.
Hopefully this one won't be as much of a resource hog when it's idle as the
[Skype](http://www.skype.com/) client on Mac OS X appears to be. OK, it's fine
when you've got 4.5GB RAM, but it seems to make my laptop (with a mere 1.5GB
RAM) slow to a crawl. For example:

    239 Skype        2.5%  2:08.76  17   268   430  22.0M  28.3M  30.8M   434M

My system has only been alive for about 3 hours, and I've not actually *used*
Skype for anything yet... Still, it's managed to consume over 2 minutes of CPU
time for, well, nothing much. Maybe the rest of the Interweb is routing calls
through my desktop as I type?

OK, moan over about Skype. :-)

If you want to get in contact with me I can be found on the following
services:

* Skype, as [mathie\_wossname](skype:mathie_wossname?call).
* Gizmo, as [mathie\_wossname](http://www.gizmoproject.com/download-small-extjs.html?id=mathie_wossname).
* AOL instant messenger, as [math1e](aim:goim?screenname=math1e).  Yes, that's a 1 (one) instead of an 'i'.  How l33t, eh? :-)
* Jabber, as [mathie@woss.name](xmpp:mathie@woss.name).
* Email, as [mathie@woss.name](mailto:mathie@woss.name).

I've a really bad habit of not setting away messages when I'm busy, and just
ignoring people if I don't want to switch out of the context I'm in. Leave me
a message and I'll get back to you pretty quickly.
