So, it's been kinda quiet around here lately. My desk is as messy as ever, but the notes never seem to make it here (mostly because I made a decision back in January to make this the "Rubaidh Company Blog" which put up a barrier of sorts to posting stuff regularly).<br&#47;><br&#47;>Expect service to resume shortly. In the meantime, you can always find me as <a title="Follow @mathie on Twitter" href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;mathie">@mathie<&#47;a> on Twitter.<br&#47;><br&#47;>Having shaken off the binds of being the official company blog, Notes from a Messy Desk is looking somewhat ... plain. I'm looking for somebody to design a new, shiny, theme (and associated Wordpress setup) that will make the most of the content here. Any volunteers? (Preferably Edinburgh-based, as I like to chat through designs and ideas face-to-face, but I'm open to trying out working remotely if you think you can make it work.)
