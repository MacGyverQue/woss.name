Clearly somebody at Microsoft has been reading [The Unofficial Apple Weblog](http://tuaw.com/).  At 10am (their time), an article is posted proclaiming that [Microsoft recommends GarageBand for advanced audio editing](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/12/microsoft-recommends-garageband-for-advanced-audio-editing/).  By 13:13, [it has been rewritten](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/12/microsoft-recommends-garageband-for-advanced-audio-editing/#c3380349).  You can see the previous version from [archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20060428201400/http://www.microsoft.com/athome/morefun/makemusic.mspx).  Utterly random, but it amuses me. :-)
