I've spent the past while reading through an extremely long interview on <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/">DrunkenBlog</a>: <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000581.html">On Being and Deliciousness, with Wil Shipley</a>.  Mostly I was looking for some insight into when <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> 2.0 would be released (and it sounds like that's not too far off), but I wound up finding it an enthralling read about a bloke that's been working with Cocoa, like, forever.

This, of course, was a distraction from what I'd intended to do, which was update my library with all the bits and bobs that have appeared since we moved flat.
