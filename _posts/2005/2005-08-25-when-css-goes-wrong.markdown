In this case, I'd somehow set the size of the 'Go' buttons to something like 150px.  Oops.  This is all part of the redesign of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.logicalware.com&#47;" title="MailManager email response management system">MailManager<&#47;a> UI where I'm fixing up the markup and styling everything I possible can with CSS, now including the forms.  I should write up a post about how I'm achieving that, but first I ought to get it right...
