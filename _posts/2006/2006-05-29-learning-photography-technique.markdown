I've been getting quite into photography over the past couple of years.  Personally, I think I'm getting pretty good, but I'd like to be able to consistently produce excellent results, both in terms of technique and composition.  So how do I go about learning 'properly'?

I picked up [Basic Photography](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0240515927) by Michael Langford quite a while back -- probably getting on for a year or so.  I've made a couple of attempts to read it, but I'm having difficulty getting past the film camera bias.  Of course, most of the techniques are transitive but I still find it somewhat difficult to see beyond the film side of it.

I do know *some* theory: I understand the relationship between aperture and shutter speed; the relationship between aperture and depth of field.  I've got a vague idea about using fill-in flash.

What I'd like to learn how to do, off-hand?  Learn how to use flash to highlight a foreground (say a person) while correctly exposing a night-time background.  Correctly expose 'difficult' scenes without just trial-and error.  Light trails.  Fast action shots (say capturing the moving foreground, motion-blurring the background).

More than anything, though, I just want to produce consistently good photographs with less of a trial-and-error component.

So, can anybody recommend a photography book which teaches theory in a manner which is more accessible for digital users?  Or a web site?  Or, given my recent excellent experience of training with an expert, I don't suppose anybody knows of a pro photographer that wants to take me under their wing? :)
