It's not often I get to head into the big city for a night on the town these days.  But tonight, we're popping in to the [Guildford Arms](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/51/5175/Guildford_Arms/Edinburgh) for a pint or two after work (Annabel should be there by aout 17:15, I'll probably be a bit later since I have to get in from Musselburgh).  Wanna join us?  Little birds tell us that the have [Orkney Dark Island](http://freespace.virgin.net/rich.13/orkneydark.html) on tap. :-)

As usual, I've forgotten my mobile phone, so if you're planning to come along, want to drop me an email, so I can get Annabel to phone you if we move on?  Or, I'm sure y'all know Annabel's number anyway -- if you don't, email me -- give us a call and find out where we are.
