OK, since I don't really have the time to code it into the application proper just now, here are some statistics:

[code lang="sql"]SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Total Guests'
    FROM guests \G
Total Guests: 120

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Guests confirmed attending'
    FROM guests
    WHERE rsvp_ed = 1 AND attending_ceremony = 1 \G
Guests confirmed attending: 50

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Guests confirmed *not* attending'
    FROM guests
    WHERE rsvp_ed = 1 AND attending_ceremony = 0 \G
Guests confirmed *not* attending: 11

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Guests still to respond'
    FROM guests
    WHERE rsvp_ed = 0 \G
Guests still to respond: 59[/code]

Not bad.  But there are a number of people I would have expected to be attending that haven't actually let us know yet...  Though I suppose parents and ushers and suchlike probably feel they don't need to let us know. :-)

If you haven't yet RSVPed, head along to <a href="http://wedding.mathieson.name/rsvp/">http://wedding.mathieson.name/rsvp/</a> and fill in your details!
