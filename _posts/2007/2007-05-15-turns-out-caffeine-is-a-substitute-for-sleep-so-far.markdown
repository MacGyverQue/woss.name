Well, I've arrived in Portland, Oregon.  The journey was remarkably easy, albeit a bit dull.  I made the mistake of saving my laptop for later on in the journey (when boredom had really set in) and discovered that the battery had already eaten itself.  (On the way back, I'll either use the laptop while I can, or remove the battery while it's in transit.)  The journey was Edinburgh &rarr; London Heathrow &rarr; Chicago O'Hare &rarr; Portland with about 19 hours of flight time and just 4 hours sitting in various airports waiting for connections.  And 27 hours being of being awake.  I think that'll mitigate the jet lag somewhat, since I wound up going to bed around 01:00 local time and getting up at, well, a bit early at 06:00 but close enough to normal waking up time.

Speaking to my colleagues in the office back in Livingston at 09:00 local time when they were just finishing up for the day was really weird.  It's bizarre to think that back home, today is nearly over already when it's not even lunchtime here!

Anyway, I've spent the morning wandering around Portland, just getting my bearings.  I walked from the convention centre to downtown, just to figure out the distance -- nice and short.  And I've wandered back to the Lloyds Centre which seems to be the big shopping mall.  The MAX Rail service is really handy (and free in the area I'd be wanting to use it!) so now that I feel I've got my bearings I'll probably starting hopping on and off it as I need.

So now I'm trying to figure out what to do for the next couple of days.  I definitely want to check out some of these microbreweries I've been hearing about.  In fact, I think I'm going to be at the [Tugboat Brewing Company](http://www.d2m.com/Tugwebsite/), as recommended by the [Planet Argon folks](http://blog.planetargon.com/2007/5/10/portland-revealed-episode-2-beertown), from about 5pm tonight (Tuesday).  I can't see me surviving long, but I'll definitely be there for a couple, if you want to join me.  Just look for the mug on the sidebar of [Notes From a Messy Desk](http://woss.name/) wearing a brimmed hat and a Guinness St Patrick's Day t-shirt. :)

On Wednesday evening, I'm planning to gatecrash the [Joyent Geek Dinner](http://joyeur.com/2007/05/15/over-the-river-and-through-the-woods) (hey, I'm even a customer of theirs these days) and I'll definitely be popping along to the dtrace BoF on Thursday evening too.  But I should find something touristy to do on Wednesday during the day, and possibly for the rest of this afternoon.

**Update** I love that Portland has free wifi, through [Metrofi](http://www.metrofi.com/).  I don't even (really) mind the adverts if that's the tradeoff.  I hate that their transparent proxy (for doing those adverts) breaks subverion-over-http.  Pah!  If you're going to insist on doing transparent proxying, could you at least pass through HTTP verbs that you don't understand verbatim?
