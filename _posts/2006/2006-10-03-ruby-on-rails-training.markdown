This is a blatant bit of advertising, I'm afraid.

[Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) (the people who brought you RailsConf Europe 2006) are running a four day Ruby on Rails course here in Edinburgh on 24-27th October.  The course was created by [Chad Fowler](http://www.chadfowler.com/) for Rails 1.1 and first delivered by him in April of this year.  I was on that course, and I can tell you it's absolutely fantastic.

So, why am I telling you about it?  Well, **I will be delivering the course**.  You'll get to spend four full days in my company, learning all about Ruby and Rails.  You'll get to hear all of my funny stories (at least twice -- I don't have that many anecdotes!), see pictures of my cats and be cajoled into nipping out for a swift 'alf when we're done for the day.

For more details, an overview of what the course contains and to book, see:  <http://www.skillsmatter.com/ruby-on-rails-course>.

Oh, and Edinburgh is a lovely city to visit too.  Well served by air & train, very friendly and has lots to do.  Why not come for the course and make a weekend of it, seeing the sites?
