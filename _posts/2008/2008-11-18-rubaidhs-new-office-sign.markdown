Shiny, eh?<br &#47;>

While I'm posting, I'd like to welcome Mark Connell, the newest member of Rubaidh's team.  He is a software engineer, working from our Musselburgh office, mostly on internal Rubaidh projects.  So keep your eyes peeled: we'll have lots of exciting new projects coming up in the next few months!
