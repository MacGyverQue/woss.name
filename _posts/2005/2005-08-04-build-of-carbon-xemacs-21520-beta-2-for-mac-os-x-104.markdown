Since the <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi-xemacs/" title="Carbon XEmacs">Carbon XEmacs</a> developer doesn't provide a binary release of his work, I have created one for the convenience of those who don't like to get their fingernails too dirty.  Hopefully it will work, and I do intend to improve upon it and keep it up to date with his work (though I make no promises!).  It can be downloaded here: <a href="http://woss.name/dist/CarbonXEmacs-21.5.20-b2-1.dmg" title="Carbon XEmacs 21.5.20 beta 2">CarbonXEmacs-21.5.20-b2-1.dmg</a>.  The main version (21.5.20 in this case) is the version of XEmacs, the next one (b2) is the version of the Carbon port and the final version (1 here) is my package version.  Let me know how you get along.  I've a funny feeling it'll only work on Mac OS X 10.4 -- at some point in the future I'll endeavour to make it work for older releases too.  In fact, my todo list for improving the package is:

<ul>
  <li>Make the packages optional (at least being able to choose not to install sumo and sumo-mule, if not more fine grained).</li>
  <li>Improve the README.</li>
  <li>Automate the build process, so that I can produce new releases without too much work.</li>
</ul>

I'll keep the <a href="/category/carbon-xemacs/" title="Carbon XEmacs category">Carbon XEmacs</a> category up to date as I make new releases, so stay tuned. :-)
