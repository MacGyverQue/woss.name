OK, so you're on site doing some work and you're pretty much coerced into using Windows.  How do you trick it out to make life less painful, particularly for the Mac addict?  Is there an equivalent of [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/)?  What's closest to [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)?  I've already grabbed [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/) and all the requisite extensions, so at least I'm feeling at home in a web browser. :)

Hopefully, we can arrange to get my laptop setup on the network here, since it's a regular gig (I'm redeveloping the [Behind the Medical Headlines](http://www.behindthemedicalheadlines.com/) web site for the [Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh](http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/)), since until then I don't really have access to my own email while I'm in this office!  Fortunately, I do still have access to [support@rubaidh.com](mailto:support@rubaidh.com) and [sales@rubaidh.com](mailto:sales@rubaidh.com) though!

**Update** what do all the cool kids use for RSS on Windows?  I feel like I'm half-deaf without NetNewsWire!
