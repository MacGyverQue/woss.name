Today's episode of [Excess Baggage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/excessbaggage/) is (predictably) about Hiroshima.  I've been meaning, every time I've heard it recently to find out the significance of the name of the aeroplane that dropped 'Little Boy' on Hiroshima: <em>Enola Gay</em>.  I'd assumed there was some significance about Enola being 'alone' spelled backwards, but I couldn't see where Gay ('yag'?) fitted in.  Wikipedia to the rescue -- from its entry on [Enola Gay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Gay):

<blockquote><p>Colonel Paul Tibbets, the plane's pilot, named her <em>\[the plane\]</em> after his mother Enola Gay Tibbets (1893â€“1983, who in turn had been named after the heroine of a novel).</p></blockquote>

I haven't managed to find out anything more about the novel, other than it being one her father liked...

On the other hand, I have discovered, through Google, that there are several sites that are basically reskins of Wikipedia, reprinting exactly the same text, links an' all.  I suppose that's one of the 'advantages' of releasing stuff under a free license, but really, what's the point of cargo-culting stuff from elsewhere, rather than linking to it, particularly when somebody who isn't paying close attention might assume it to be your own work?
