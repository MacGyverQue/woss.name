I had a thought while I was heading out to [RubyConf 2008](http://rubyconf.org/).  I'm currently looking for more contract Ruby work and so I was planning to noise up a few folks and see if there was anything going.

What I hadn't realised is that I (and other UK developers) are particularly attractive to US companies right now since, due to the exchange rate fluctuation, **my daily rate has dropped by 25% in the last 6 months!**

Back in May 2008, when I was at RailsConf, the exchange rate was almost $2 to the pound sterling.  Let's say that, hypothetically, I charge Â£100/hour (I don't, though I wish I could!) since it's a nice round number.  That would mean I would have to charge $220/hour to a US company just to maintain the same level of income (adding on a somewhat arbitrary 10% to cover the extra costs involved in getting money from a US company to my UK bank account).

Now, the exchange rate has dropped to about $1.50 to the pound.  That in turn means that what I have to charge has dropped by 25%.  Let's continue the example from above.  In order to maintain the same level of income, I would now only have to charge $165/hour.  Doesn't that sound a whole lot more hospitable?

So, US companies:  if you've been toying with the idea of making use of the awesome pool of UK Ruby talent that's available, **now is the time to try it out!**

And, to the UK Ruby talent; if you've always fancied the idea of remote working for a US company, now is a good time to convince them it's worth a try.  But only once I've got my books full again. :-)

Oh, and the main, subtle, take-home point of this post: **Rubaidh Ltd is looking for new work and is happy working for anybody, anywhere!  <a href="mailto:mathie@rubaidh.com">Get in touch!</a>** :-)
