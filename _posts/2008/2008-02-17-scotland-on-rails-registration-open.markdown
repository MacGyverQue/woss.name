With Keynotes from <a href="http://www.koziarski.net/">Michael Koziarski</a> (nzkoz) and <a href="http://dablog.rubypal.com/">David A Black</a>, along with another 15 Rails luminaries doing talks on bleeding-edge topics, it's set to be the best Rails conference this side of the pond!<br />
<br />
The conference is on Friday 4th April - Saturday 5th April, with a charity tutorial day on Thursday 3rd April to raise money for the utterly awesome <a href="http://www.chas.org.uk/">Children's Hospice Association Scotland</a>.<br />
<br />
Head along now to <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/register">scotlandonrails.com/register</a> to book your place.  I'd get there quickly; there is limited space and we anticipate it selling out!
