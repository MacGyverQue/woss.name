  content: <p>[...] This weekend I set up Capistrano 2 for the first time. I was very
    eager to try it, especially given all the glowing blog posts about it. Everyone
    seems to think it&#8217;s the best thing since sliced bread. Capistrano has clearly
    become the standard for Rails application deployment. But after two days of wrestling
    with deploy.rb recipes, I have a few issues to share. [...]<&#47;p>

Last night I gave a wee presentation to the Scottish Ruby User Group about Capistrano 2, and some of the ways I've been working with it over the last couple of weeks, since for some reason I seem to have been immersed in it for a couple of different projects.  It's nothing particularly groundbreaking, but I figured it was useful to demonstrate some of the things it's capable of, and how much easier it makes my life on a daily basis.  You can find a copy of the slides here, complete with my speaker notes:

* [Capistrano 2 Rocks My World (Keynote format)](http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;dist&#47;capistrano_2.zip)
* [Capistrano 2 Rocks My World (PDF format)](http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;dist&#47;capistrano_2.pdf)

The speaker notes are probably completely different from what I actually talked about because it turned out that the way I was setup, I couldn't read my notes!  Hey ho, you live and learn!
