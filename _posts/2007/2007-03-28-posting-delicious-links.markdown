Finally, yesterday, I sorted out a workflow to easily make a note of links to interesting things from [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire) to [my del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/mathie).  So you can look forward to a one-post summary each day of all the articles I've read and found particularly interesting.  I'm making an effort to write a short summary along with each link.

I'm using [WebnoteHappy](http://www.happyapps.com/webnotehappy/) along with the latest NNW beta so I've got a nice easy workflow to post an item (ctrl-apple-'), write a description, add some tags, then post it to delicious.  Dead easy!  Hopefully easy enough that I will carry on doing it! :-)
