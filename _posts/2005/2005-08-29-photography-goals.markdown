Annabel and I were discussing yesterday about goals for my current photography <del>obsession</del> hobby.  It's always good to have goals, something to aim for, a concrete achievement.  I've had in the back of my mind that I'd like to sell some of my photographs sometime, though I'd been thinking of doing it mostly online, through stock photography agencies.  Trouble is that everyone and his dog is submitting pictures to the popular agencies online since it's <em>so easy</em>, which means the competition is high.  Still, it is extremely easy, and there's almost no running costs involved, so there's no harm in trying.

But Annabel has had an even better idea.  Next year, I will set up a stall during the <a href="http://edfringe.com/">Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a> (maybe at the Arts &amp; Crafts fair behind St John's?) to sell framed photographs.  Actually acquiring a stall sounds pretty easy -- Annabel looked into it for a friend recently -- but there's still the additional per-print costs involved: paper, printing, framing.  I've already got most of the kit I need (so long as I don't want to print anything larger than A4), so that's all OK.

It's a lofty goal.  I do take <em>some</em> nice pictures, but often it's luck rather than skill.  So there's still a learning curve there.  And there's the additional organisation, which I suspect I'd need some help with.

One thing that was occurring to me is how to work the financial side.  Something tells me that the best thing to do is set up a proper business for it, keep all the cash inside the business and write off my camera purchases as business expenses.  Since all the kit was bought inside this financial year, I wonder if it's worth setting up the business sometime soon so that I can fiddle the accounts to maximum effect...?  But I've no idea how these things work, other than what I overhear in the office.  Something to bend Andy &amp; Clare's ears about sometime methinks...
