When I first started with git, like most folks, I suspect, I came from a
subversion background. And most of the repositories I interacted with on a
daily basis were subversion repositories which weren't going to change any
time soon. To be honest, I didn't get a great impression of git and git-svn
from that experience.

What really convinced me git was great was actually using it natively without
the bridging layer at all. And git-svn still left a bit of a bad taste in my
mouth so I've been avoiding it ever since. (I talk like an old timer here --
I've been using git full time for less than a month still -- but you would
have to prise git from my cold, dead, paws.)

I've just started working on a project for a lovely new client, extending
their existing Rails application to have the usual shopping cart bits and
bobs. They're pretty entrenched with Subversion still and have no intention of
changing any time soon. So I figured this was the time to revisit git-svn and
see if I could make it work better for me. *And it does.* It seems to be that
you have to have the *"git mentality"* already sussed in your brain for
git-svn to make sense. And once you do, you're sorted.

So if you've tried git-svn before your transition, and didn't like it, come
back again later after you've used git natively for a while. It will feel more
natural eventually.

Oh, and check back in the next couple of days for an example of my workflow
with git-svn, comparing it to native git remote operations, to see what I
mean.
