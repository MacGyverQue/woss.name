  content: <p>Well, when you finally look thoroughly at lightroom and if you decide
    to switch, drop a line. My case is exactly like yours, save for the fact that
    my only machine is a Powerbook G4 with 1 GB RAM. If you decide to go for Lightroom
    despite the investment you made, I think I should consider it, too...</p>

So [Adobe Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/) has been released.  (What's with sticking 'Photoshop' in the middle there?  I do dimly recall you developed that product too Adobe, and if you'll only get a move on and produce a native Intel build -- CS3 -- you'll get more cash out of me for that too!)  I've been broadly aware of its development, being an avid reader of [James Duncan Davidson's](http://blog.duncandavidson.com/) blogs.

To be honest, I've been avoiding looking at Lightroom.  I have a lot invested in Aperture: I bought it at full price the day it came out and never quite got around to claiming the rebate when 1.1 was released; I've spent a lot of time using it; and I've got 15,000+ images sitting in its library.  But James' post this morning -- [Lightroom: Select Photos by Lens](http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2007/02/lightroom_selec.html) -- intrigued me.  I tried to select photos based upon which lens I'd used in Aperture a few months back, and given the information available to me, felt I had to guess based upon the focal length & aperture, at which point I started applying keywords to determine the lens.  I was sure that this information was stored in EXIF but I couldn't see it in Aperture's UI.  Perhaps I just missed it, but anyway...  It just works in Lightroom.  I can browse by lens, camera (ie is it my or Annabel's camera that took this shot?) and a host of other different things.

It makes sensible use of the IPTC location metadata!  If I specify a location for my photographs, it creates a hierarchy in the metadata browser for locations.  Fan dabby dozey!  I've been, again, manually emulating that with keywords in Aperture because I didn't feel the IPTC support was actually doing much of any use.

And that's not all.  Again, it's totally subjective, but when looking at the detail of my photographs (I've only checked a couple) in 1:1 in develop mode, they look sharper, more clear, better pictures!  I'll have to sit with the two side by side this evening to do a proper test, but that's my first impression.

Oh, and it feels faster too.  Again, totally subjective and probably all in my imagination because I've only had one cup of coffee this morning.

All this boils down to?  I'm not going to dismiss it out of hand, just because I've invested time and money in Aperture.  I'm going to give it a proper shot.
