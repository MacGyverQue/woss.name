Wow! What a fantastic conference! It is, without a doubt, the most vibrant,
exciting conference I've ever attended. I suppose that's not really saying
much, since the majority of cons I've been at were VoIP-oriented, but the next
one still has a lot to live up to!

I've got something in the region of 40 pages of hand-written notes on all the
talks and keynotes I attended, a large stack of business cards to sort through
and a backlog of blog posts from other people about the conference, so I
suspect it's going to be a few days before I'm fully caught up.

It doesn't help that I started developing a cold on Saturday and that I'm now
off work, ill, wrapped up in a duvet and hot water bottle, cooking up some
Lemsip Max Strength to mainline...

Absolute highlights of the two days:

* DHH's keynote (and the rant at the end of the panel discussion which should have been the tail end of the keynote had he not run out of time).
* Kathy Sierra's keynote: Creating Passionate Users.
* Dave Thomas' closing keynote, which deservedly got a standing ovation, even though I feel he started out on slightly shaky ground...
* Unit testing javascript.  Hopefully, I'll never really need to write much JS, but it's always good to know that protoype and script.aculo.us are well tested.
* The talk on ModelSearch.  Hopefully I can get my grubby paws on that code soon, because I have an application which would read *sooo* much better for it.
* Talking with tens of other developers who are in exactly the same boat as me, having gone 'indie' during 2006 using Rails.

Right, I think I'm off to download the [TextMate Basics for Rails](http://peepcode.com/articles/2006/09/02/textmate-basics-for-rails) screencast from [topfunky](http://nubyonrails.com/)'s new venture, [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com/) and see if I can still remember it after the Lemsip has worn off...
