And for  a change, I not only carried my camera around on my back, but I took some photos too!  It's the first opportunity I've had to play around with a new lens I picked up in London in September, a <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Zoom_Lenses/EF_24-105mm_f4_L_IS_USM/index.asp?ComponentID=306159&SourcePageID=26341#1">Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM</a>.  It's an amazing lens -- my first ever with image stabilisation -- and I'm finding I now get a better 'hit rate' with photos that work rather than the focus being a little soft or the cropping not quite right.  Perhaps that's just a bit more practice too. :-)<br />
<br />
I'm particularly pleased with this image, panning with the train as it moved to give the illusion of speed, though I suspect I should either not have used fill-in flash, or at least used second-curtain sync, to avoid the weird blurring of the figures in front of the train.  And I probably ought to correct the white balance a little.<br />
<br />

<strong>Update</strong> Well, I've now tweaked the images slightly and re-uploaded them.  The colour balance looks a bit nicer, I reckon.  Ooh, and presets in Aperture kinda rock.  Find one image with a good point for selecting white balance, set that as a preset and then apply the preset to all the rest of the images taken under the same conditions.  Nice.  I think I'll have to copy some 'standard' white balance presets from Adobe's Camera Raw importer, since I always felt that was something I missed...
