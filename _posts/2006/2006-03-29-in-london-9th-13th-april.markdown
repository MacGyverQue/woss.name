  content: <p>sorry... will come and visit some time... maybe in the summer?  just
    dont really feel in the right mood to cope with the nasty place just yet.... want
    to wait till i'm happy an bouncy so i can pretend its an exciting new place to
    visit rather than the depressing place i used to live in... if that makes sense..</p>

I'm going to be in London from some point on Sunday 9th April (I still haven't booked flights or trains or whatever, so I'm not *entirely* sure when) 'til about 18:00 on Thursday 13th April.  I'm attending a 4-day [Ruby on Rails training course](http://www.skillsmatter.com/ruby-on-rails-course) at Skills Matter.  (Mostly now, I'm feeling that it's going to be a confidence booster, and a chance to pick up on bits of Rails that I've glossed over; I'm surprised at how quickly I've become productive in using it!)

Does anybody fancy meeting up for a beer?  I'll be based out in Romford (my sister and her bloke live there), but I'll be somewhere near Oxford Circus each day.
