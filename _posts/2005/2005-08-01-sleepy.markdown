Hrm.  I still feel like I've been short-changed on my sleep, after Saturday night's debacle.  And my coffee cup is empty!

Poor Saffy this morning.  She has a scrunchy ball-like thing she plays fetch with (only that one, no other object at all, but she <em>will</em> fetch this one and bring it back to you to throw again) and she accidentally batted it under the  wardrobe in the study.  She spent the next 20 minutes trying to stretch her paws under the wardrobe to bat it out again, but to no avail.  She was looking all grumpy when I left.  I suppose I should try and poke it out with a stick or something.  (I'm not moving the wardrobe -- it's too heavy!)

Well, I seem to have 'launched' the new version of this site, by mentioning it in a few other places.  Here's hoping the traffic picks up, and some nice people comment and maybe even accidentally go clicky on some of the widgets that might earn me a few pennies. :-)  This would all be more likely to happen if I was to write some useful content, though, eh?
