  content: ! 'Hi Graeme, appreciated your more detailed comments on Aperture - I totally
    agree that this looks like a REALLY hot app for Apple. I honestly can''t imagine
    why ANY pro photographer wouldn''t go and buy this, AND a Quad G5 AND two 30"
    displays, it really looks THAT good.


    It''s like the team at Apple sat down and thought " what are the problems that
    pro photographers have that huge CPU grunt, multiple HUGE monitors, and core image
    accelerated by the GPU will solve?" THis is the right way to spec a product.


    I''m not a pro photographer, but as someone said elsewhere this product has elegance
    and ''sex-appeal'' that is part of what all pro photographers are striving for
    in their work.


    I will criticise Apple for many things but sometimes you just know they have got
    it right in a way that no-one else has.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has entered the professional digital photography arena, with <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a>.  I've been utterly engrossed in reading all the information I can about it this morning.  Oh my god!  I need this software!  It does all the things I try to do with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/bridge.html">Adobe Bridge</a> but, from the looks of the movies, works seamlessly.  I spent an hour or so last night in the Bridge, trying to sort out some photographs from a recent trip to Butterfly World.  It's <em>sooo</em> slow -- in particular for categorising photos and applying particular camera raw settings to each image.  Even sitting in the slideshow mode, flicking through photographs to rate down the obviously bad (out of focus, really badly composed) shots, I was waiting 4 - 5 seconds to flick from one image to the next.

Now I'm not sure Aperture is going to be <em>that</em> much faster (though there really is room for speed improvements there -- how about caching a screen-quality copy of the image in addition to a thumbnail for starters?) but the whole workflow seems that much more natural.  It has a loupe tool, for examining closeup portions of an image while you are browsing through a selection (did I manage to get that bit in focus just right?).  Actually, I can't see how to do that in the filmstrip focus portion of the Bridge right now -- it would appear that I'd have to load the image into the Camera Raw tool or Photoshop itself, magnify it and use the move tool to pick the place I was wanting to look at!  Maybe I don't know how to use the Bridge that well but, even still, Aperture is so much more intuitive.

The meta data part sounds really nice too.  One of the reasons I switched from using <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> in the first place (other than the fact that it doesn't support CR2 Canon Raws) was its poor meta data support.  The Bridge is better, in that it supports full EXIF and IPTC meta data, but the keyword support was still really poor.  I want to make strong use of keywords in the same way as I use tags here and on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and I want hierarchical sets of keywords.  Bridge can do that, but it's not intuitive and it's awkward.

So far with my experiences in Bridge, it's also a file-based tool.  Now there's a problem: you can't save from Photoshop into raw format.  (Not that you'd want to, otherwise you'd be overwriting your original image!)  But there's a disconnect between the original image and the final JPG you produce for uploading/printing.  I find that irritating since it adds an extra burden on my mind to recall where different versions of files are.  Like iPhoto, everything in Aperture seems to be held within it's own storage (which it calls a Vault).  The originals and your modified versions are seamlessly kept together.

Now all these impressions are pure conjecture from reading every single word on the web site and watching every single movie and being a total Mac Fan Boy.  I haven't actually had a shot of it or anything.  But as soon as it's actually available (the Mac store says 'delivery in 6-8 weeks'), I <em>will</em> have a copy.  I wonder who I'd have to kill/sleep with/bribe to get an early seed of it...

Of course, the major trouble is that it costs &pound;349.  Still, that's cheaper than Photoshop, and far less than I've spent on photography hardware this year.  What's the point of taking all these nice photographs if they get stuck partway along my workflow and never see the light of day?  The ideal would be for me to do &pound;350 worth of photography work to cover it...  Anybody want their picture taken?

And that's the other thing.  It will (just) run on my Powerbook.  My iMac isn't powerful enough.  So really I'd have to be getting hold of one of those shiny new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">Dual Core G5s</a> to run it on...
