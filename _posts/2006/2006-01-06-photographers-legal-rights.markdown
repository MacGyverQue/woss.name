  content: ! 'Mark: Good point, though that legislation is British, rather than American,
    isn''t it?  I''m not sure that the freedom to take photographs is so complete
    here in the UK anyway.  Those articles also make the distinction been shooting
    photographs and publishing them -- you can''t necessarily get away with publishing
    the photographs you''ve taken...


    Tim: Ooh, excellent, thanks.  I''ve grabbed and printed out the former (though
    it''s still lying on the printer so I''ve not read it yet), and as soon as I create
    a passport-sized photo, I''m going to join the AOP as a ''friend'' so I can acquire
    the latter.'

I've been skimming a few articles on photographers' legal rights -- what you can shoot and publish -- this morning:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2005-12-29-camera-laws_x.htm">New digital camera? Know how, where you can use it</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.kantor.com/blog/2005/12/legal_rights_of_photographers.html">Legal Rights for Photographers</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.rcfp.org/photoguide/">Photographers' Guide to Privacy</a></li>
</ul>

which make interesting reading.  Basically, unless you actually invade somebody's privacy where they would reasonably expect some privacy and the photograph is not in the 'public interest', you can shoot almost anything, almost anywhere.  OK, you might get hauled up before a court for other criminal acts you commit at the same time (eg trespass) but the photographs are perfectly legal.

Unfortunately, this is a US-centric opinion.  Sometime in the not-too-distant-future, I intend to find out what the situation is in the United Kingdom.  Any pointers?
