  content: ! '<p>Fine looking baby - definitely an eye for the lens! I''m not sure
    why there would be so much noise though at only 1600. Canon touts this camera
    on par with the Nikon D700 which can go up to 2000 without noticeable noise.<&#47;p>


    <p>Also, have you shot at small f-stops like f16? I wondered if there''s any diffraction
    problems (halo''s).<&#47;p>


    <p>Great post!<&#47;p>'

(It was alleged at the store that they were the only outlet in Scotland to currently have them, and that I was therefore the second person in Scotland to purchase the 50D!  I'd love to know who beat me to the punch and got their paws on one Friday night!)

Anyway, a few first impressions (bearing in mind that I'm upgrading from an EOS 350D, these are not necessarily anything new about the 50D, but a win from the upgrade to the next line up):

* It's a lot chunkier than the 350D.  It fits my hand better, but it's a bit big for Annabel to heft.  That is not a problem. :-)

* The 6.3fps shooting is just terrific.

* My 4GB CF card is apparently only going to hold about 150 photos.  So I've ordered a pair of 8GB cards. :-)

* I'm not going to be giving up Noise Ninja Pro any time soon after all.  There was still *very* noticeable noise between Malcolm's eyes when this photo was taken.  (At ISO 1600 because I'd left the ISO at "auto".)

* My photography workflow utterly relies on Aperture.  And the camera currently doesn't work with Aperture.  Boo.

* The joystick control is really useful for navigating menus and such.  Takes a bit of getting used to because it behaves more like a small D-pad than a joystick though.

* The utterly massive, crystal clear 3" LCD screen (in comparison to the 350D at least!) is just incredible.

* Prints, even those of Malcolm throwing up, are gorgeous.  A4 prints are coming out at >350dpi.

I'm running out of superlatives, so I'll stop now.  Let's just say I'm ... pleased with the upgrade. :-D
