OK, I'm bored.  It's one of those evenings where I didn't actually notice it getting dark 'til I looked away from the computer and realised I couldn't see anything else.  Usually one notices these things thanks to the not being able to see the keyboard any longer, but Apple have solved that with their backlit keyboard...

Anyway, I've been doing a little bit of fiddling around with Quicken.  Apparently, since we moved to Musselburgh, I've <del>drunk</del> bought 65 pints of Belhaven Best in the Auld Brig Tavern, our new local.  I can tell because we always drink best, it's &pound;2.05 a pint, and it works out exactly.  (I know we've eaten crisps there, but clearly I've gotten away without buying them!)  I did change my mind from <em>drunk</em> to <em>bought</em> since, though I did feel a little hung over on Wednesday, I certainly didn't feel 9 pints worth of hung over!  I suspect I might have been buying more rounds than not...  On the other hand, when we're there with John, he does tend to head to the bar more often than Annabel or I do, so it probably works out about right in the end.

I miss having a pub nearby with <em>decent</em> beer.  In particular, a pint of Orkney Dark Island or Old Speckled Hen would go down a treat just now, but no such luck.
