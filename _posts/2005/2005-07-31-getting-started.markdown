Welcome to my new home.  I hope you like it.  I think I'm now happy with the general setup of my new web site, using a blog format for creating new content rapidly.  Hopefully that means it will stay more fluid and up to date than a static web site otherwise would.  I will be adding the content from my previous version of the site over the next few days, so stay tuned.

What do you think of the site design?  It's basically just the default WordPress theme with some minor tweaks to allow Google ads and I created a image for the header.  That's what my desk looks like right now.  Well, as of a couple of hours ago, anyway.

It's Sunday morning.  For some bizarre reason, I couldn't sleep last night so I've been up hacking on this since about 03:00.  It's now just gone 08:00.  The cats are going loopy around the flat, with the sudden mad energy of having just been fed, Annabel is still in bed with a cup of tea, listening to the radio and reading the Groniad from yesterday.  Actually, that's probably a fib; she's probably sensibly gone back to sleep again.

Yesterday mostly involved a hangover from drinking too much in the Jooglie Brig on Friday night, so it was a lazy day, watching television, snoozing, sorting through some paperwork.  Since Dominos has just recently opened in Musselburgh, we felt the need to test drive it, and an offer of 'Any pizza, any size' naturally means one has to order two large pizzas: Veg-a-roma and Tandoori Hot.  Mmm.   I'm having some of the remainder for breakfast now, along with my morning coffee.  Pizza was rounded off with watching <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008WJ6C/mathieoftheen-21">Repo Man</a> &mdash; yeah, it's an odd film...
