Everybody in NetNewsWire today is posting about the same thing: [Death threats against bloggers are NOT "protected speech" (why I cancelled my ETech presentations)](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html).  People can be mean sometimes, and it seems to be an accepted part of interacting online (to think of the flamewars I've witnessed on Usenet and Other Places, for examples), but this is going more than a few steps too far.  When I heard Kathy talking at RailsConf Europe, it was the highlight of the 2 day conference.  She totally inspired me and changed the way I think about interacting with my customers.  It'll be a really sad day if we never see her doing the conference circuit again because some lunatic has spoiled it for the rest of us.

I suspect (and hope) that it's just a joke that's gone badly wrong.  And since the police are now involved, it's gone *very* badly wrong for the protagonist too.

Makes you think, though, doesn't it?  Maybe I should be more careful (and less public) about myself.  After all, it's not exactly a challenge to figure out where me and my family live.  Thanks to a new UK law, it's in the signature of every business email I send out (and pretty much every other one because it's my default `.signature`!).
