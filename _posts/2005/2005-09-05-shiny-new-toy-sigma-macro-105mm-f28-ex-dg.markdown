Well, yesterday I cracked.  I'm now the proud owner of a <a href="http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3253&navigator=5">Sigma Macro 105mm f/2.8 EX DG</a> lens.  I've not yet had the chance to see any output from it on my laptop or in print, but I can just <em>tell</em> it's wonderful.  I can fill the entire frame with mere specs of dust and the short depth of field at f/2.8 produces some wonderfully composed images.  I think I need to take a walk somewhere with lots of detail stuff to shoot sometime in the next few days.

But I'll need to empty my memory cards first.  I spent Sunday night shooting fireworks from Calton Hill.  I haven't had a chance to look at them yet, but I suspect there'll be a couple of nice ones.  I think I got the composition about right, with tthe fireworks in the air, Edinburgh castle highlighted bottom left, and the clock tower on the hotel at the right side.  Unfortunately, the air was quite hazy, so there's undoubtedly going to be an orange glow over everything (from the sodium lamps around), but I reckon that'll be tweakable in Photoshop.

It took me a while to get the right place to stand, so that I could brace the tripod against a fence -- initially I was basically hand-holding the camera, bracing the tripod against myself, while I was perched with one foot on a wall, the other on a fence.  I suspect those first shots might be a little too blurry. :-)

But we'll see.  I should really sort through them tonight, particularly since I've got 1GB worth of the pictures and only 1GB worth of compact flash on which to take photos...
