Disorganised is suddenly realising that it's 09:20, you ought to be in the office at 09:30 (which is nearly a 10 minute walk), and you're still sitting in front of the laptop, supping coffee, having not showered, dressed, had breakfast, fed the cats, or any other regular morning chore.  Breakfast became two chocacino muffins, munched as I was walking into the office; shower was postponed ('til lunchtime, if I remember to go home for lunch!); and it turns out Annabel had already fed the cats.  So I still made it in about 09:30, albeit a little dishevelled looking...

<strong>Update</strong>  Ah, that's better.  There's nothing like a lovely invigorating shower first thing in the ... afternoon. :-)
