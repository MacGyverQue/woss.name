We find that it's a scalable, solid, secure, maintainable platform for deploying Rails applications and our UK hosting service is based entirely upon OpenSolaris running on Sun hardware.  We think it's awesome.<br/><br/>With that in mind, we would like to get together with other people in Scotland who share our enthusiasm, along with those who are interested in learning more about what OpenSolaris has to offer.  We have created the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/scosug/">Scottish OpenSolaris User Group</a> (currently just a placeholder 'til I get around to adding some content).  Right now, we're planning to meet up next Wednesday (14th January) after <a href="http://www.techmeetup.co.uk/">Tech Meetup</a> to discuss what we can do as a group.<br/><br/>If you'd like to get more involved in the group, please <a href="http://mail.opensolaris.org/mailman/listinfo/ug-scosug">join the mailing list</a> and, if you can, pop along to the meeting next Wednesday (come along to Tech Meetup too, you can hear me talking about Ruby on Rails!).<br/><br/>Incidentally, the image was inspired by a conversation yesterday with a few friends.  Apparently I may be the only person in Scotland who has an interest in both Ruby and OpenSolaris? :-)
