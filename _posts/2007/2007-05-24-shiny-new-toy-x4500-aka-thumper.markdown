Ever since Jonathan Schwartz [announced the Sun X4500](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/the_rise_of_the_general) (AKA "Thumper", which is a far better name!) I've been lusting after one.  I couldn't quite explain why (what would I want with all that storage?!?) but it just seems to be the perfect solution to storage.  So, when Sun announced their 25th Anniversary sale, which brought the cost of the Thumper down to Â£18,000 in the UK (yes, that's the equivalent of Â£0.75 -- or $1.50 -- per Gigabyte!) I knew I just had to have one.

So I chatted to some people, tweaked Rubaidh's finances, put together a business plan (which is still super-secret, unless you happen to chat to me in the pub about it!) and put in the order.  Fortunately, Rubaidh's finances are sufficiently fluid just now that we actually have that sort of money sitting in the bank, though it has used most of our 'lean period' reserves.  So this business plan does have to work!

Apart from anything else, it is a 4-core AMD Opteron system with 16GB of RAM.  So it will be powering a number of Rubaidh's web applications as soon as I co-locate it with [my favourite hosting partner](http://xeriom.net/).  But first of all, it's being delivered to the house so that I can do some testing (mostly of the drive-failure-scenarios kind).  It's scheduled to turn up between 1pm and 3pm today.

At 77kg (170lb), I'm really hoping that I can convince the delivery folks to help me unpack it, too!  Otherwise, I'll be bribing some friends round with promises of, well, probably shell access to the beast. :-D

Question is: what do I call it?  All of Rubaidh's servers are currently named after brands of [Scotch Whisky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky).  I seem to recall that there's a (relatively) new distillery in Scotland that hasn't actually produced a bottling yet, but I can't recall its name.  That would work nicely...
