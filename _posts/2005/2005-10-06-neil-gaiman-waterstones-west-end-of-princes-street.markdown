I can't believe I've forgotten to mention!  It must have been all the trauma of everything else on Saturday!  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.neilgaiman.com&#47;journal&#47;journal.asp" title="Neil Gaiman's journal">Neil Gaiman<&#47;a> will be doing a talk &amp; signing in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.waterstones.co.uk&#47;">Waterstones<&#47;a> at the West End of Princes Street, on November 9th, at 18:30.  Tickets are &pound;3 (which is refundable against the cost of a book bought at the time).  Annabel &amp; I already have our tickets -- though I get the impression that, unless she gets to heckle about 'comics', Annabel's ticket is available to the highest bidder!  Who else is coming along?  Since the staff at Waterstones seem to have a varied knowledge about which tickets are available for what events, my tip is to go straight to the cash desk on the first floor.  They do actually have tickets behind the counter there...

Still reading <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0755305078&#47;mathieoftheen-21">Anansi Boys<&#47;a>.  It's getting to be lots of fun. :)
