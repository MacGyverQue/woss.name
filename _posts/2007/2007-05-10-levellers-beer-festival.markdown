I just discovered that the [Levellers](http://www.levellers.co.uk/) are playing at some folk/beer festival just outside Edinburgh on June 2nd.  You can find out more about it here: [Prestonpans Music and Ale Fetival](http://www.prestoungrange.org/gothenburg/html/beer_festival_2006/beer_festival.htm).  It's conveniently near the 26 bus route, so should be easy enough to get to.  Unfortunately, Annabel's probably going to be off galavanting with her mum, so I'm wondering if anybody else happens to be going along, or wants to?  I've no idea if tickets are still available.  But it'd be great to see the Levellers live...
