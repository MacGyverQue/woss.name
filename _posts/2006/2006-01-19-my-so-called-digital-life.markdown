[Ethan](http://blackrimglasses.com/) is running a series of blog articles about his 'so-called digital life' which makes interesting reading.  Normally I'd just bung these in my [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) feed to appear in a daily summary (and the sidebar), but they're way more exciting than that.  So:

 * [Part 1 - The environment](http://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2006/01/15/my-so-called-digital-life-pt-1-the-environment/)
 * [Part 2a - The Applications](http://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2006/01/18/my-so-called-digital-life-pt-2-the-applications/)
 * [Part 2b - The Applications](http://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2006/01/18/my-so-called-digital-life-pt-2b-the-applications/)

I'm tempted to do something similar...  Then again, I'd be listing most of the applications he's talked about so far ([TextMate](http://macromates.com/), [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/), etc).

And more from the interesting-articles department: [Merlin Mann espousing the usefulness of Path Finder](http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/17/7-things-pathfinder/).  I've now grabbed myself a copy of [Path Finder 4](http://www.cocoatech.com/pf4/) to try out though, since I don't touch the Finder much, I'm having trouble remembering it's there...
