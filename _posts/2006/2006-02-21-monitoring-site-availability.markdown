I'm getting the hang of this lazyweb stuff. :-)

What do you use for monitoring the availability of web sites and systems?  I'd like to have some system which will notify me if any of my web sites (and possibly other key application services) disappear, preferably by email and SMS message to my mobile phone.

In the past I've used [Mon](http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/) and [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/), but this time around I don't have the spare (ie not one of the machines I want monitored!) resources to set this up, and I'd rather 'outsource' the responsibility for setting up and maintaining the system.  (It's all about 'core' and 'context' -- I'd much rather be getting on with the 'core' work and let somebody else take care of the 'context'.)

So, what do you all use for monitoring your business-critical web applications?
