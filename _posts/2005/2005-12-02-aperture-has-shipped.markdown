  content: Maybe its just me, but the two times I've bought things from the Apple
    store its parcel tracking has been completely wrong (Your ipod is currently passing
    through Amsterdam! No, its just been delivered) or woefully behind (Your ibook
    has shipped! I know I have it my hands right now).

  content: ! 'derek: Ah, see, that''s why I phoned up this morning, got the details
    of who''d be shipping it, called them and checked.  It''s "on the van".  I wish
    the van would hurry up -- not so''s I can start playing with it, but just so''s
    I know I can play with it this weekend!'

Woo!  According to the shipment tracker, <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a> has reached Edinburgh:

So hopefully it should turn up at the office sometime tomorrow.  I shall be posting some first impressions in the evening...
