OK, I admit it, it's not <em>just</em> Benjy that's keeping me awake.  I kept him awake last night, poking him every so often while I was lying on the couch reading.  I've not been sleeping well for a few weeks now, but last night was just taking the piss. :-/  I gave up even trying to sleep around 04:00 and have been up, either fiddling on the laptop or reading, ever since.

And <em>now</em> my brain is choosing to decide it's stupidly tired.  While I'm in the office trying to write documentation that isn't going to make any sense at all when I re-read it tomorrow.  I think I'll refrain from showing it off to other people 'til after it's been redrafted.

Still, I have now nearly finished reading Chasm City...
