    sorry, have to say it - but the Aussie exchange rate is looking even better. For
    me to charge AU$110 per hour means I''d only charge a UK company roughly £50 with
    corresponding onflow from there...</p>


    <p>Anyone interested in a cheap, but experienced Aussie Ruby developer? ;)</p>'

    can maintain your existing rate (assuming you get business at that rate already)
    then you can earn ~20% more without doing anything at all.</p>


    <p>The reason I prefer this approach (unless reducing your rates would enable
    you to fill your timesheet) is because if the pound gets stronger again, you might
    get locked into your lower rate and become "stuck" - especially on longer projects.</p>'

  content: <p>double grin... I'm in China.  nuf said.  Our company is seeing a nice
    increase in business as a result of the global economic situation.  If you are
    looking for skilled, experienced rails developers that can operated at a much
    lower cost, take a look at China.  Shanghai has a very nice rails community.</p>

I had a thought while I was heading out to [RubyConf 2008](http://rubyconf.org/).  I'm currently looking for more contract Ruby work and so I was planning to noise up a few folks and see if there was anything going.

What I hadn't realised is that I (and other UK developers) are particularly attractive to US companies right now since, due to the exchange rate fluctuation, **my daily rate has dropped by 25% in the last 6 months!**

Back in May 2008, when I was at RailsConf, the exchange rate was almost $2 to the pound sterling.  Let's say that, hypothetically, I charge £100/hour (I don't, though I wish I could!) since it's a nice round number.  That would mean I would have to charge $220/hour to a US company just to maintain the same level of income (adding on a somewhat arbitrary 10% to cover the extra costs involved in getting money from a US company to my UK bank account).

Now, the exchange rate has dropped to about $1.50 to the pound.  That in turn means that what I have to charge has dropped by 25%.  Let's continue the example from above.  In order to maintain the same level of income, I would now only have to charge $165/hour.  Doesn't that sound a whole lot more hospitable?

So, US companies:  if you've been toying with the idea of making use of the awesome pool of UK Ruby talent that's available, **now is the time to try it out!**

And, to the UK Ruby talent; if you've always fancied the idea of remote working for a US company, now is a good time to convince them it's worth a try.  But only once I've got my books full again. :-)

Oh, and the main, subtle, take-home point of this post: **Rubaidh Ltd is looking for new work and is happy working for anybody, anywhere!  <a href="mailto:mathie@rubaidh.com">Get in touch!</a>** :-)
