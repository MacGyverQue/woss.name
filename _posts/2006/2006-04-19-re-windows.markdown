Thanks for all your lovely suggestions (and condolences!) yesterday. :)  For RSS, I realised I'd be as well using [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/) online, since it syncs with NNW anyway.  [AppRocket](http://www.candylabs.com/approcket/) is proving to be a satisfactory application launcher, attached to the same key sequence as Quicksilver.  It's nowhere near as functional, but at least I don't just hear a *clunk* every time I hit the QS shortcut. :)

As for text editors, I'm messing around with [RadRails](http://www.radrails.org/) with [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org), though never having used the IDE before (I'm actually rather proud of not having ever used Java in anger since graduating from University, and even then it was only writing (bits of) a compiler!), I'm finding it a steep learning curve.  And just to keep my options open, I'm investigating [XEmacs](http://www.xemacs.org/).  For somebody that was a die-hard XEmacs fan before switching to TextMate, I'm surprised I forgot all about it!

But mostly I'm still working on being able to use my own PowerBook in the office, and get ssh access to the outside world!
