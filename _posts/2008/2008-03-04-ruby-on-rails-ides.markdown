  content: ! '<p>I am using NetBean 6 on Ubuntu Gutsy and feel it''s ok, just that
    as any java IDE is a bit slow. I use NetBeans because I haven''t found something
    better for linux. I''m not that good in vim, not used with the shortcuts and it''s
    hard to navigate around files, in NetBeans I have the "Go To file" search like
    in TM.

    I think for the course it might be good to use a IDE just to be consistent, NetBeans
    works on all platforms (so is RadRails). Then users will use whatever they feel
    confortable (TextMate for lucky ones, E, vim, etc.).</p>'

    I used XEmacs before, and will return using as soon as the project is finished.
    I never liked IDEs, but I finally gave NB a try for Ruby. I''m so disappointed.
    It is slow, uses lots! of memory and the auto-completion does not work like it
    should and sees errors where there none. I''m on a windows box at work, but hey,
    I don''t think it would be any better at home on my Linux box.</p>


    <p>The only good point in the IDE is to easily retrieve the files, and the uses
    of generators. For the rest, XEmacs has faster, better coding functions.</p>'

  content: ! '<p>I''ve taught several Rails classes over the last 8 months or so and
    have found that using a simple text editor works best.</p>


    <p>The first time I taught the class, I didn''t dictate the editor and let the
    students use their favorite. This didn''t work out so well, for several reasons.
    It was harder for them to follow along, and most of the students were more worried
    about learning the Rails features of their IDE than actually learning Rails.</p>


    <p>What I''ve found works pretty well is using TextMate for the Mac users and
    E text editor (http://e-texteditor.com/) for the windows users.  They''re similar
    enough that students are able to follow along, but they don''t get too distracted
    by playing with the editor.</p>'

    <p>With regards to IDEs, avoid like the plague! When it comes to developing something
    in a <em>scripting</em> language, an IDE is pointless, cumbersome and in the way!</p>


    <p>If you <em>have</em> to pick one, Aptana / Eclipse would probably be the best
    bet, if you''re willing to put up with the annoying interface and slowness. At
    least it''ll be just as awful an experience on all platforms.</p>


    <p>I have to be the evangelist here and say, Vim has been ported to Mac and Windows,
    and will do the syntax highlighting and code completion... but I guess teaching
    people how to use Vim would be out of the scope of your course - but no more out
    of scope than teaching them how to get around a potentially unfamiliar (and certainly
    horrible) IDE.</p>


    <p>Maybe you should survey your potential students and find out what they use
    for other development work (if they do it).</p>'

  content: ! '<p>I would personally opt for using a text editor and the command line
    -- it''s a much simpler solution which will allow you to concentrate on teaching
    Rails rather than teaching how to use IDE ''X''.  My opinion is that IDEs, for
    Rails work at least, just get in the way.</p>


    <p>I would teach on your Mac using TextMate if that''s what you use -- it''s one
    of the most common set-ups after all.  All the Rails developers I know, bar none,
    use this set up.  You can then earn style points by Cmd-Tabbing into a Windows
    VM and demonstrate doing the same thing in eTextEditor if you like :-)  Seeing
    how slick Rails development is on the Mac is an important thing for people to
    learn!</p>


    <p>Competency on the command line is such an important part of Rails development
    (not to mention deployment) that it seems a shame not to encourage this.  It''s
    also so simple from the command line to create projects, add migrations, run script/console
    etc -- much quicker than any IDE!  Rails newbies should know how to do all this
    stuff, just as newbie Java developers should know how to run Ant on the command
    line, not just from Eclipse.</p>


    <p>So, yes, go with the text editor/command line option.  It''s what Agile Web
    Development teaches, and I bet most of your students will have that book.</p>


    <p>p.s. If there is demand, you could always run a separate course on specifically
    Rails using an IDE!</p>'

  content: ! '<p>On windows, Ulraedit has been my loyal companion for absolutely everything
    for absolutely ages. It''s a text editor that''ll stay out of your way for most
    things, but if you want it to you can get it to do more.</p>


    <p>I''m all over TextMate like beans on a bridie if on a Mac</p>


    <p>I''ve used NetBeans for Java development in the past and with NB6 heralding
    rails support I''ve been tryin it for the last few months. Lots of nice little
    things going for it like code formatting, but I''m beginning to find it slightly
    annoying. It''s slow to respond, crashes from time to time, throws auto-completion
    dialogues at me when I don''t want them and annoyingly it renames the rails directories
    in your NetBeans project; config becomes Configuration, football becomes Soccer,
    etc.</p>


    <p>I think if you know an IDE/editor inside-out, know all the shortcuts and tips,
    then it will work for you. I''ll probably end up back with Ultraedit when on Windows.</p>


    <p>If you''re learning rails I think you should go with a text editor because
    you''ll concentrate on and learn more about rails without being distracted by
    learning the IDE at the same time.</p>


    <p>Graeme, I was on your rails course and was not phased by the platform/editor
    you were using. In fact, it was interesting for me to see how YOU were developing
    rails applications. Whatever you use make sure the IDE/editor noise is minimal
    - all I want to see is the code, directory structure and command line magic.</p>'

  content: ! '<p>I''ve been doing this recently--teaching hands-on Rails courses.  The
    students are primarily PC users who like to avoid the command line.

    Many of them are java developers with some experience using Eclipse.

    I on the other hand try to avoid PCs at all costs, and have worked using command-line
    + emacs for many years, though have recently switched to TextMate.</p>


    <p>I''m using my MacBook to teach and they are using PCs. I show them both modes
    of work: I demo things to them both using TextMate + command-line mode, AND then
    demo how to do the same thing using Aptana as an IDE.</p>


    <p>Even though I think my demos of how easy things are from the command line are
    very compelling :), they almost always stick to Aptana and are not motivated to
    try the command line. (And, given that command-line work seems much more of a
    pain from a DOS window, this is perhaps not surprising).</p>


    <p>So while I share your dislike of IDEs, I have learned that most of my students
    do feel much more comfortable with access to an IDE.  (Aptana is probably one
    of the best choices at the moment and has the benefit of looking much the same
    on both mac and pc.)</p>'

  content: <p>Why waste space teaching TM or E or Eclipse, when you can just say "edit
    config/environment.rb" and leave it to individuals to decide how they would prefer
    to do that? An appendix or introduction that offers a few options and says where
    to find the shortcuts for the recommended editors or IDEs should be more than
    sufficient. There are tons of other programming books out there, and beyond telling
    you not to use a word processor (if it's a total beginner's book), they pretty
    much leave it up to the reader. It's just text files after all...</p>

  content: ! '<p>I don''t teach Rails courses, but I do teach other IT topics...</p>


    <p>I would absolutley not use an IDE for this course.  Otherwise, as other commenters
    have stated you''ll spend time teaching the IDE that you should be spending teaching
    Rails.  The students will all go back and pick the development environment they
    want to use (or are forced to use) so it''s a rather pointless exercise to pick
    NB or Eclipse for your class.</p>


    <p>I would select one simple, graphical editor and require the students use it
    on their Windows laptops.  Could be as simple as notepad, though I think something
    with a <em>few</em> more features would be a good idea.  If you allow some students
    to use notepad, some to use wordpad, some to use UE, etc. two things will happen...
    First, you will be slowed down when you look over their shoulders and offer them
    help because you will need to adapt to the display and usage of their editor,
    and second, the students won''t be able to as easily help each other for the same
    reasons.</p>


    <p>The absolute best case would be for your projector to be showing the exact
    same thing your students are doing.  As a Mac user myself, I realize the challenge
    in this.  If you can run the Windows editor your students are using in a Parallels
    or other VM window, that would be ideal.  Otherwise, using Textmate would be OK,
    but I would suggest setting up a theme that matches the colors and such the students
    see.</p>


    <p>Early in my teaching career I tried instructing using one set of programs with
    a particular look and feel, and expecting the students to use/do something else.  I
    promise that if you try this you will regret it.</p>'

I'm in the process of developing a new Ruby on Rails training course.  While I personally abhor every full-blown IDE I've tried (intelligent code completion's all well and good, but it has to be faster than just looking up the documentation!), I can see a few advantages for basing it around an IDE:

* Everybody is using the same proscribed tools to work through their examples, rather than me demonstrating concepts on my Mac with [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), while everybody else in the class is stuck on Windows laptops, having to scrape around to find a suitable text editor.  It's a win for screen shots in printed documentation accompanying the course, too.

* For some bizarre reason, the vast majority of people who come to Ruby on Rails courses feel comfortable in an IDE.  Usually [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/).

* Most of the IDEs out there are cross platform, so I can teach on Mac OS X while the students have to hammer away at Windows laptops.  They can also take their newly learned skills back home and feel comfortable working on whatever platform they have at home.

So while I personally don't use IDEs and don't like IDEs, I think I can see the advantage of teaching with an IDE.  I suppose the alternative is to pick one editor (the [E Text Editor](http://www.e-texteditor.com/) would be my default choice since it's not entirely unlike TextMate) and actually use Windows while I'm teaching the course.  But that would seriously cramp my style. :-)

So, there are a couple of things I'm looking for from my loyal audience here:

* Is my thinking right?  Is it better to have one consistent IDE for demonstration and use?  Is the Right Thing&trade; (AKA The Rails Way) not to use an IDE, and therefore should I be teaching all of the Rails Way of things?

* Do you use an IDE to develop Ruby on Rails applications?  Which one?  Why?

* In particular, this is aimed at the Windows folks: if you *don't* use an IDE, how do you productively develop Rails applications?
