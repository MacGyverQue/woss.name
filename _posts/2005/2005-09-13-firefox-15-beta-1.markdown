[Firefox](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/) has a new beta release: [1.5 beta 1](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/).  I'm now using it and it seems shiny enough.  First impressions?  The preference pane is more Mac-like.  And the performance -- particularly navigating through history, switching between tabs and creating new tabs -- has drastically improved.  SVG support ought to be pretty neat, if I find a web site with vector graphics on it. :-)  And I'm looking forward to incorporating CSS 3 goodies into the new [MailManager](http://www.logicalware.com/) UI.  Fortunately, the new UI code appears to be working well with Firefox 1.5b1 already, so hopefully I've not been doing anything <em>too</em> evil...
