  content: <p>Jonathan, nope, I don't have .Mac.  I guess the keychain access it was
    requesting was because it automagically noticed you do have .Mac and attempted
    to integrate with it?  By refusing the keychain access, it would have assumed
    that .Mac wasn't setup after all?</p>

  content: ! '<p>Lorin: Ah, that works, to an extent, although it would be more useful
    if, when dropping items on the drop-dock, it could be configured to pop up a dialog,
    asking for metadata to be set at the time.  Instead, the complete list of collections
    is shown and, if you assign it to a collection, it no longer turns up in the unsorted
    smart collection.</p>


    <p>I suppose, in a GTD-like way, I just drag everything to ''Library'' and treat
    ''Unsorted Items'' as an inbox, for later sorting...  My workflow would like to
    have things sorted as I drop them in, though.</p>'

  content: <p>I liked HogBay Notebook a lot as a writing tool, but never got past
    my trial period. Mori is its successor, but I'll wait until stuff I messed with
    in HogBay make it back up into Mori. Meanwhile, I use DevonThink to collect and
    categorise all kinds of stuff, and love it. I suggest you check it out... esp
    once version 2 is out. It will do all you ask including powerful searches, meta-tag
    stuff, concordance, suggest related documents and so on.</p>

Trawling through my news feeds this morning, a nuumber of people mentioned the release of [Yojimbo](http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml) from Bare Bones Software.  I've had it on my kGTD todo list for a while to evaluate [Devonthink Pro](http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php) as a general reference system for my GTD mind-like-alcohol (just like Dave Allen's Mind Like Water, only confuses people and is potentially dangerous!) workflow.  Only I've never gotten around to doing it.  And BB claims that this one is *so* simple to use, that it's fully integrated with Tiger technologies.

It looks pretty enough.  I do particularly like the Drop Dock, for dragging random useful things to (although I wish in could be positioned on the bottom of the screen, either side of the dock, since that's effectively dead space for me).  It seems pretty fast, very easy to use.  But, from a 10 minute overview while I was eating my breakfast, here are the additional features I would like:

* Tags.  I use [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) and [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) tags a lot.  And I would like to implement the same sort of system for my own personal data store.  It's lazier than creating a proper, ordered taxonomy, but it's also quicker (particularly if the system is set up to remind you of the tags you've already used) and I find it useful.  OK, so most of the words that I'd choose as tags are already mentioned in anything I'd store (or I could paste it on the end, or add it in the comments myself, I suppose), but I tend to 'normalise' things slightly so that it's easier for me to find.  I guess using labels is getting there, but I want more than 8 tags, and I work better with words than colours.

* Nested collections.  I suspect I'll wind up with so many different collections of material that the folder list down the left will become unweildy.

* Smart collections.  Rather than having to manually add items to particular library collections, I'd like to generate collections automatically from some metadata.

* Lots more metadata.  I likes metadata. :-)

I think I'll persevere with it over the 30 day trial, see if I can make it fit into my workflow.  After all, I'm already finding it easy enough to use that I'm randomly dragging 'useful' web pages into it for later grepability.
