I was sure I'd seen a plugin for Rails or a gem which allows one to nicely, visually, display the differences between two pieces of text.  So I thought to myself "OK, that's a solved problem, I'll go find it when I need it for this project."  I'd thought the [comatose](http://comatose.rubyforge.org/) plugin just did it, or perhaps some other tool I'd been using recently.

OK, so it was a tool I'd been using recently, but it turns out it was [Writeboard](http://www.writeboard.com/).  Does anybody happen to know if the code which does that fancy juju is publicly available, or if there's another implementation which does something similar?  Just because I'm, well, y'know, lazy and I'd rather write something new than reinvent the wheel. :-)
