Apparently, this is not a joke, though you may find it hard to believe.  It's Email-meets-Second-Life: [3D Mailbox](http://www.3dmailbox.com/).  Apparently, amongst other things, your spam is represented by 'sumo' guys that you can feed to the sharks.  The bit that got me, from the overview page:

> In the second level, set at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), every email is a Boeing 747!

I wonder how they visualise spam in level 2?  Planes which have been hijacked by terrorists that you can send your F-17s to take down...? ;-)
