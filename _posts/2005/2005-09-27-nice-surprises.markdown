There was a nice surprise waiting for me when I got back to work today: my pre-ordered copy of [Anansi Boys](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0755305078/mathieoftheen-21) by Neil Gaiman had arrived!  I suspect it will be skipping the book queue and following on immediately from my current book, [Stories we could tell](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/000715125X/mathieoftheen-21) by Tony Parsons, which I picked up at the airport in Athens to keep me going through the four hour flight home.  I'd already exhausted the reading material we brought with us...

The other nice surprise was slowly unveiled, from last night when we opened the post, to this morning when I phoned them back.  Our sofas are being delivered on October 5th!  Finally, after more than 3 months of sitting around on the carpet (or dining chairs) to watch television, we'll now have a sofa -- each, in fact! -- to curl up on and watch DVDs. :-)  Our home is nearly complete, I think!
