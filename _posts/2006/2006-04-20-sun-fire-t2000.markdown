  content: ! '<p>Joe: There''s a possibility I''m being really dim, but no, I don''t
    think so.  There''s no graphics adapter in the T2000 and, while you might be able
    to install one, it''d have to be a low profile PCI card, and I don''t have anything
    like that kicking around.  I guess there''s a possibility you could interact with
    it blind, with a USB keyboard, but I certainly doubt that would work for the SC
    side of things.</p>


    <p>Now I''m trying to get my head around the Solaris patching system.  Oww.  I
    think I need a dummies guide to Solaris...</p>'

    <p>Why emulate when you can do the real thing :-)</p>

  content: ! '<p>I just got a trial T2000 also.  Hooked the serial port to a nearby
    PC''s port and was able to use Hyperterm to configure it.  Reminded me of something
    I would have done ten years ago.  I love the "#." control sequence to go back
    from console mode to SC mode.</p>


    <p>Anyway my reason for posting - my machine is SO LOUD.  I can''t even believe
    any machine would make that much noise.  I was sure the machine had a hardware
    problem and thought it was overheating, and cranked its fans up to max to compensate.  Reading
    your post makes me think they are just always this loud.  Do the fans'' speeds
    vary, or is the machine really just always SO LOUD?</p>'

    for...</p>


    <p>Ole: The only thing I''ve found that makes it quieter is to put it in another
    room and turn some music on!  I think it really is just that loud...</p>'

I'm currently staring at a spinning `/`, trying to drown out the noise of fans below me with Placebo:

    Sun Fire T200, No Keyboard
    Copyright 2005 Sun Microsystems, Inc.  All rights reserved.
    OpenBoot 4.19.0, 8184 MB memory installed, Serial #67267664.
    Ethernet address 0:14:4f:2:6c:50, Host ID: 84026c50.

Yeah, that's right, I have just received an evaluation [Sun Fire T2000](http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t2000/test/overview_a.jsp?name=A) for 60 days to play around with.  Very first impressions?  **Argh!** I had to go speak nicely to my local [Sun Resellers](http://www.accesscomputing.co.uk/) to borrow a serial console cable since it didn't ship with one.  I then had to dig out an old PC laptop with a working serial port and get that running with `minicom` just so that I could set up the network ALOM interface.  But now I have it booting and I'm doing the initial configuration.

The idea is that I'm going to attempt to do some [detailed performance analysis](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20060221) of the machine running RoR apps, comparing it to the Quad G5 I have sitting next to me.  Hopefully, I might even then be able to deploy it somewhere, running RoR apps. :)
