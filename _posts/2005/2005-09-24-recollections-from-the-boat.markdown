<p>After finishing yesterday's marathon entry, we did pick up the ferry tickets pack to Pireaus, leaving at 09:45 on Saturday.  (Note to self: the outbound journey was &euro;1 cheaper than the return; perhaps it makes more sense to buy both legs of the journey at Pireaus next time?)  Then we nipped into the supermarket to pick up a bottle of Kitron and one of the nice bottles of Retsina we'd had at lunch the previous day.  After going back to the apartment, for a shower, we dropped in to tell Nikos we were leaving the next day and to pay the bill -- 8 nights at &euro;50/night totalling &euro;400.  Not bad for a two bedroom (each with en suite) apartment, I think?</p>

      <p>We returned to Oasis for dinner -- there was a nice symmetry to it being both the first and last place we ate.  We had:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tzatziki</li>
        <li>Taramasolata (not so nice as we'd had before, more like what you'd find in Sainsbury's in the UK)</li>
        <li>Skordalia</li>
        <li>Fried Zucchini</li>
        <li>Stuffed vine leaves (again with the wonderful lemony bÃ©chamel sauce)</li>
        <li>Moussaka.  This was the highlight!  In particular I think what made it special was the ground nutmeg added to the bÃ©chamel sauce topping).</li>
        <li>Fried battered squid.  This was really quite bland and boring compared to the rest of the wonderful flavours.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A couple of bottles of Retsina and a complimentary Ouzo rounded off the evening.</p>

      <p>We got up on Saturday morning about 08:00, had a quick coffee, finished packing and left.  Hopefully we didn't leave anything important behind!  Nikos gave us a lift back to the harbour with all our bags (which I'm sure have gotten heavier -- maybe we're smuggling a cat or two back!) and handed us a gift -- salt &amp; pepper shakers and a napkin holder.  Extremely tacky looking, but it was a lovely gesture.</p>

      <p>While we were waiting to board the Blue Star Paros, I took some pictures of boats and of the tiny church on an island in the harbour.  The only access to it was by boat and it just so happened that a service was about to commence, so there was a boat ferrying people across to the island.  The congregation had already overflown the building itself, with people all crowding around outside.  I suppose having a church on an island guarantees a captive audience, which is handy since I gather Greek Orthodox services can last for hours!</p>

      <p>We had breakfast on the boat: cheese pies and spinach &amp; feta sausage roll-type things (spanakopita).  And now, just to make things interesting, we've sailed into a thunderstorm!  The rain has started to ease off again, so it's safe for the oiks to resume their seats instead of hiding under awnings, and the difference between flash &amp; roll is about 8 seconds, so I think we're just skirting by the edge of the storm.  We've still a couple of hours 'til Piraeus, so I might as well try to fill in the gaps in the story so far (working backwards, since my memory of more recent things is better, so I might as well record them accurately, rather than forget much of everything!).</p>

      <h3>Wednesday</h3>

      <p>After drinking a little too much beer (OK, a lot too much beer!) on Tuesday night, Wednesday kinda failed to happen.  I nipped out to the supermarket for breakfast supplies -- bread, stuffed vine leaves, feta cheese &amp; aubergine salad -- about 12:30, having spent the morning reading my book.  Annabel dragged herself out of bed when I returned and we snacked on stuff whilst reading our books on the balcony.  The sun got a bit much for me, so I headed back to bed to read, while being awake became too much effort for Annabel!  I spent the afternoon finishing 'Die Trying' and taking a look through some of the lizard photographs on the laptop.  I think I have managed to get one or two good 'uns. :-)</p>

      <p>In the evening, we went to a Mexican restaurant for a change.  We had a big jug of Sangria to wash down dinner, which was:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tortilla chips with salsa, cheese, jalapenos black beans, etc to share.</li>
        <li>Vegetarian soft flour tacos for Annabel.</li>
        <li>Rare steak with blue cheese sauce for John.</li>
        <li>Beef fajitas for me.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>They're always great fun, creating wraps with lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, salsa and the fried beef/onions/peppers, then trying not to spill the contents over everywhere as you eat. :-)  It wasn't particularly spicy, but very tasty.  A complimentary margarita rounded off the evening, when we decided that we'd be getting up stupidly early on Thursday morning.  And Annabel had been awake &amp; out of bed for nearly four hours by this point!</p>
