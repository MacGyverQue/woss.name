<a href="http://www.scotlandis.com/">ScotlandIS</a> is hosting an event in Edinburgh at the end of the month: <a href="http://www.scotlandis.com/index.cfm/page/84/event/204/">Agile Development Day</a>.  The developer portion of it is in the afternoon, and the highlight sounds like one of the folks from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a>'s new Scottish office talking about the success of agile methodologies.  There will also be a hands-on demo of using Scrum.  The evening portion is aimed at managers, with a talk from a project manager at JP Morgan about the successes of agile development.

I've just booked in for both sessions -- since we're ScotlandIS members, apparently we get it as a freebie.  Anybody fancy joining me?  And helping to defend the world against the .Net and Java weenies who will surely be there? :-)
