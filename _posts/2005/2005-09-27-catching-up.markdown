Well, that's my inbox dealt with.  Mostly.  Most of the mailing lists have either been read or discarded unread.  I've gotten mostly caught up with work -- integrating Roan's IE compatibility changes for the <a href="http://www.logicalware.org/">MailManager</a> UI into the page templates themselves and finding out what's been happening while I've been away.  I've done the Software Update dance -- stuff from Apple, updating <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">DarwinPorts</a>, making sure my ruby gems are up to date, grabbing the latest <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> &amp; bundles.  I've made a start on the RSS feeds -- paring down all the ones I'm not too bothered about reading, scanning the important ones -- deferring most of the actual reading 'til later.  Only 1217 unread items remain there...

Once I've caught up with my finances in Quicken, and I've archived all the Canon RAWs off my laptop (I nearly ran out of disk space on holiday!), I think I'll feel about ready to start tackling actual projects, rather than 'clearing the decks'.

One of the projects is to take some of the ideas I like from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749922648/mathieoftheen-21">GTD</a> (which I finally got done reading over the holiday) and implement them in the workflow I call 'life'.  But more on that later.  For now I have XHTML to diff...
