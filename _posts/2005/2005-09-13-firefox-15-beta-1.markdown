  content: Hmm, I've just grabbed a processor-optimised build of 1.0.6, from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/ozjason/moz/"
    rel="nofollow">ozjason's page</a> and I'm trying it out just now.  It feels a
    lot slower than the beta of 1.5 beta 1.  However, the Google Toolbar is back (it
    doesn't appear to work with Deer Park releases yet), which is handy 'cos I got
    to gloat about my own personal web site having a higher page rank than <a href="http://www.logicalware.com/"
    rel="nofollow">work</a>. :-)

<a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> has a new beta release: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">1.5 beta 1</a>.  I'm now using it and it seems shiny enough.  First impressions?  The preference pane is more Mac-like.  And the performance -- particularly navigating through history, switching between tabs and creating new tabs -- has drastically improved.  SVG support ought to be pretty neat, if I find a web site with vector graphics on it. :-)  And I'm looking forward to incorporating CSS 3 goodies into the new <a href="http://www.logicalware.com/" title="Logicalware MailManager Email Response Management System">MailManager</a> UI.  Fortunately, the new UI code appears to be working well with Firefox 1.5b1 already, so hopefully I've not been doing anything <em>too</em> evil...
