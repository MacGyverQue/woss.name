<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/809557741/" title="Annabel outside the front door"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1412/809557741_9586f8e0ac_m.jpg" alt="Annabel outside the front door" class="alignright" style="border: solid 1px #000000; float: right;" /></a>I've been lusting after a lens that will give me wide angle shots on an APS-C sized sensor for a while.  There's just something wonderful to me about the effect it has on clouds in a landscape shot.  And being able to photos of a room is a great bonus.

It's also the first time I've really played with Lightroom's develop settings, turning the image into black & white, boosting the blues to get a really impressive looking sky.  And, err, using the spot tool to hide a couple of blemishes. (Don't tell Annabel I said that!)

I'm quite please with how, what was effectively a quick snapshot to try the new lens, has turned out.
