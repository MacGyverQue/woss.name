OK.  I admit it.  I'm just insanely jealous and I want an iPhone too.  But what with being in the UK, I'm just going to have to be patient and wait until, what, Q4?  So I'm getting bored of hearing about how wonderful/crappy it is everytime I visit my news feeds in NetNewsWire.  So, here's a tip for those of you in the same boat: how to mark all iPhone-related entries as read:

* Create a new 'smart list' (from File &rarr; New Smart List&hellip;).  A dialogue box will pop up for creating the smart list.
* Name the list "I'm so jealous all you guys have iPhones and I don't".
* Match on the following conditions: "Title, Description or Summary", "Contains" and enter the word "iphone".
* Click OK to create the smart list.
* Select the smart list from your list of feeds.  Note that you have, like, 800 unread articles about the i-bloody-phone!
* Click the 'mark all as read button'.
* Done!

At first, it will mark that list as read, but won't appear to update the unread counts of all your other feeds (like that Mac folder you've got with 2,000 unread items) but never fear.  Just quit and restart NetNewsWire and the counts will be correct again.  (It seemed to do weird things with the unread article counts before I restarted, for some reason.)
