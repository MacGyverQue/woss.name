<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>'s author, Allan Odgaard, has announced the final release of <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2006/01/06/textmate-15/">TextMate 1.5</a>.  I joined the Cult of TextMate around 1.1b15, and have been using it daily since then, for all my software development, most of my documentation, web site development, pretty much everything in the world ever, in fact.  It's absolutely wonderful.  In fact, in some (work-internal) documentation I was creating recently I wrote:

<blockquote>
  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
  <p>...</p>
  <ul><li><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>.  OK, it's not quite a necessity, but it's by far the best editor available for Mac OS X and I will mock you mercilessly when you use anything inferior. :-p</li></ul>
</blockquote>

So I'm pleased that 1.5 has made it out the door.  I almost secretly wish it was version 2.0 so that I could pay for another license, just to say <q>thank you</q> to Allan for all his hard work!
