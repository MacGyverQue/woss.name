I've been operating "under the radar" for a couple of weeks now, hard at work on exciting new things.  I'm not quite ready to announce publicly what I'm up to, but rest assured it's exciting stuff (email me, and I'll see what I can do about going into more detail).  Expect a return to the surface in the next week or so.

It's not that I'm still at the pub, as has been suggested! :-)

Meanwhile, can anybody shed some light on what's new and exciting between [Switchtower](http:&#47;&#47;manuals.rubyonrails.com&#47;read&#47;book&#47;17) 0.10.0 and 1.0.0?  I haven't dug around the blogosphere much, but there's a distinct lack of Changelogs kicking around -- all I've noticed so far is somebody mentioning the release, with a lot of bug fixes and a few new features...
