I've not managed to tackle anything from the todo list in the previous post.  Well, I've done a basic setup of [Gallery 2](http://gallery.sf.net/) and I'm about to try out [WPG2](http://wpg2wiki.ozgreg.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) to see how it'll work.  But I have installed [wp-cc](http://firasd.org/studio/wp/wp-cc/) to allow me to easily select a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license for the site (attribution share-alike, for the record).  And I'm sure I've done other stuff too but, having now been awake for 16 hours after an abortive attempt at sleep last night, I'm having trouble remembering my own name, never mind anything else. :-/
