# Notes from a Messy Desk

This is the latest incarnation of my blog, [Notes from a Messy Desk](http://woss.name/).
It's been through a few iterations over the years, most recently with
Wordpress. I got tired of upgrading to avoid security vulnerabilities more
often than I posted, so I'm trying something different.

It's now built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and a very simple visual
layout courtesy of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), of course.
(Pull requests to tighten up the CSS would be gratefully received!)
