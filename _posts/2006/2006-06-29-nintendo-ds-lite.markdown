    but i think the (main?) difference is the lite one is smaller and, well lighter

    <p>the much stronger backlight and smaller size, plus, longer battery life. Not
    that these matter to my daughter who''s campaigning for a DS. Does she want the
    lite? Heck no. It doesn''t come in pink, and white''s ''scarry'' for some unexplained
    reason. At the moment you''ll see Argos, et al, also don''t have any special offers
    for the lite version. It''s about Â£99 with no free game included, whereas the
    plain DS is Â£99 and includes Nintendogs, or whatever. Ho hum. I''m hoping that
    the prices will equalise a bit more next month.</p>'

  content: <p>The screen on the original DS has a tiny viewing angle and isn't very
    bright.  The Lite fixes both of these problems -- even on the lowest setting (of
    four!), it's much much brighter than the original DS and you can view it from
    nearly any angle.  If you saw them side by side, you wouldn't even consider getting
    an original DS.</p>

  content: ! '<p>i think this "lite" version is a waste of money.

    the original was enuf light for me and i never stoped to look at the side of the
    screen. why would i want to look at the side anyways?

    do the main difference is that the newer version is lighter?

    who really cares? it''s not like the original was a real pain to carry anyways.

    know the screen thing might be a good point here. but there both hand helds. so  both
    screens will be small no matter how u look at it.

    over all

    bid waste of money.</p>'

  content: <p>I have yet to purchase a nintendo ds. But from all that I have read,
    I think that it would be quite an experience to own one. I enjoy playing the hand
    held systems, and as you know, the manufactures are always trying to improve an
    existing product. I like the challange that all the new games bring. I also like
    the idea of the touch screen. I think that it brings more of a challange to the
    game. And the system.</p>

  content: <p>i'm going to get one and the main thing is the touch screen and the
    size of the pen and i agree with chris about the light and i have the GBA SP,
    GBA, and 2x GBC (game boy color) and the light has only been in the SP and newer
    and i'v been shoping and the DS Lite was about $130 at 3 places and the old DS
    is about $100 so $30 for a smailer, britter, biger pen it just seems like a waste
    of money but the thing i'm worred about is the touch screen so $30 for a stronger
    touch screen is crazy unless you're stronger then an average persoin then i would
    say buy the new one.</p>

  content: ! '<p>We just got DS Lites (http://blog.daveastels.com/articles/tag/nintendo).  They
    totally rock!  Thomas had a DS (from last xmas)... the DS is a great improvement.  Smaller
    and lighter, sleekier.. they have an almost Apple-esque look &amp; feel.  As mentioned
    the screen is brilliant.  The lowest setting (the light is alwasy on) it about
    the saem as the DS screen.  Then there''s 3 brighter settings.  The power switch
    is on the side... out of the way of accidental pressing... and takes a "slide
    and hold" to turn it off.  Beefier stylus, and a cover for the GBA slot.  Very
    nice machine.</p>


    <p>Now I just need to get up tp speed on writing software for it and I can really
    have some fun.  Porting ruby to it would be a fun project.</p>'

  content: ! '<p>We scoured the city for two Nintendo DS. I got a DS lite and my husband
    got a DS for each kid. We''re hoping the differences aren''t enough to cause envy.
    The White DS Lite came with a SKIN add on (maybe that makes it less scarry?).
    It looks less hefty, but if the lite does as much if not more it should make up
    for one kid feeling shortchanged.</p>


    <p>Thanks for publishing this  - it helps me to be aware as to stave off competition

    got the same resolution and you can pick a WL up for 5$ as opposed to 30$!!!!!</p>

  content: ! '<p>Well i havent yet purchased a DS or DS lite.. but i was in a delemma
    about what one to buy. I know that the DS lite is much better but on the whole
    they do the same things.. but the lite is smaller brighter and with other little
    helpfull things. But i decided to forget about the money and just buy the one
    that i really want.. and one thats not out of style and that i wouldnt regret.
    I think alot of people buy the ds because the other one is expensive but you might
    regret it when you see ither people with the ds lite!

Hmm.  Clearing up the plethora of open windows and tabs on my desktop this morning (before restarting to apply the Mac OS X 10.4.7 update), I noticed a few interesting browser tabs:

* 2 x Nintendo DS for sale on eBay.
* [Brain Age](http://www.brainage.com/launch/index.jsp)
* [Tetris DS](http://www.tetrisds.com/)

It wisnae me!  I suspect somebody might be tempted by [Dixons Tax Free](http://www.dixonstaxfree.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=dixons.more&action=full&id=16) at the airport this afternoon...

Ooh, I see it has a slot for Game Boy Advance games.  At last I might be able to play the games I bought a few years ago with my GBA that I then decided was a pile of crap because you couldn't see much due to the lack of backlight!

And today's silly question:  what's the difference between the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo DS Lite?  Apart from the Lite version having just been released?
