I post here fairly infrequently and irregularly. I'm sure the fact that I'm posting over at the [FreeAgent Engineering Blog](http://engineering.freeagent.com/) too isn't going to help that at all.

Just yesterday I had a bit of an adventure in the Ruby on Rails logging code. You can find the article on the engineering blog: [Understanding the Rails Logger](http://engineering.freeagent.com/2011/10/12/understanding-the-rails-logger/).

If Ruby, Rails, testing, scalability, automating your infrastructure and a wee smattering of accounting is the kind of thing you're interested in, you could do worse than keeping track of FreeAgent's engineering blog. I've got some very smart colleagues with some really interesting stuff to say...
