Oops.  Annabel mistakenly allowed me out to <a href="http://www.bordersstores.co.uk/">Borders</a> alone.  I did acquire the book I was actually looking for: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514055/mathieoftheen-21">Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide</a> (AKA The Pickaxe).  I'd been meaning to pick it up for a while to complement <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/097669400X/mathieoftheen-21">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> that I'm (slowly) working my way through.  The second edition is a <em>vast</em> improvement upon the first (which is <a href="http://phrogz.net/ProgrammingRuby/">available online</a>), covering all the new and exciting features of Ruby that have appeared since the 1.6.x series.  Including the documentation syste, RDoc, for example, which was where the original book first let me down.

But then I happened to find <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201433079/mathieoftheen-21">Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</a>.  It is <em>the</em> reference for C and portable UNIX programming.  I'm ashamed to admit that I never bought the first edition.  So when I discovered that it had been fully updated by Stephen Rago, how could I resist?  And then there was <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321334876/mathieoftheen-21">Effective C++</a> which has been updated with a third edition.  I'd borrowed and read the second edition while I was at <a href="http://www.aculab.com/">Aculab</a>, and had been meaning to buy myself a copy anyway.

On the plus side, I couldn't find the other two books I was looking for: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584502274/mathieoftheen-21">C++ for Game Programmers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514063/mathieoftheen-21">Pragmatic Version Control Using Subversion</a> (which, really, I want for work, so perhaps I should con them into ordering it).  So it could have so much worse!
