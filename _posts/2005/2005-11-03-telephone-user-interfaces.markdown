  content: The phones at work don't have a button but do respond just as well if you
    press down in the cradle for then earphone (they have an indentation where a button
    would have gone).

  content: ! 'Yes it''s a bloody awful idea.  Siemens are particularly bad for it.


    You sometimes get an ''end call'' type button or ''disconnect'' option in a menu.


    One of those terrible pieces of interface design.  in Siemens defense, at one
    point they moved from induction coils to light sensors, so you can ''hang up''
    with a finger in the right place of the handset holder.  Doesn''t beat a big button
    though.'

  content: Yep, this is a Siemens phone, and it would definitely appear to be one
    of those induction coil versions, but not fancy enough to have been blessed with
    menus or buttons or, well, features...

  content: If it has any programmable buttons it might be possible to make one of
    them 'disconnect', if it's one of the basic-basic phones then you're scuppered.  Daft
    design.

This is a request to anybody that develops user interfaces for 'digital' phones (the one I have on my desk talks Q.931 -- ISDN -- I think).  A real, live, hook button is actually quite useful.  OK, it looks really cool if there's no button in the cradle to detect if the handset has been replaced (ooh, look, it just knows by <em>magic</em>!) and I'm sure there are reliability problems with such switches.

But see when you've got the phone against your ear, you can't hang up!  So, while making several calls, you have to replace the handset and pick it up again.  Worse still, if you're listening to a ringing tone and nobody appears to be about to answer, what happens if they <em>do</em> answer somewhere in the point between the phone leaving your ear and hitting the cradle?  They're going to think somebody's been really rude and hung up on them!
