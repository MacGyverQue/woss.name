    Apple introduces Mighty Mouse with 4 Buttons - That is a fundamental change in
    the Apple Human Inteface Guidelines. But it doesn''t surprise me at all: Mac OS

  content: ! '[...] My Mighty Mouse has arrived this morning! I&#8217;ve plugged it
    in, installed the drivers (which only work with Mac OS X 10.4.2+ &#8212; for anything
    else, it just behaves like a standard scroll-wheel mouse) and set it up. The mouse
    &#8216;buttons&#8217; are odd. Really it still feels like a single button, but
    the action it performs depends upon where on the shell you push. Very bizarre.
    So far, I&#8217;ve assigned the left and right buttons to their usual role, the
    middle button to bring up the Dashboard and the side button to bring up Expos&eacute;
    (which is pretty much the default). I&#8217;ll probably find a better use for
    the latter two later&#8230; The scroll ball is neat - very sensitive, doesn&#8217;t
    take much movement to scroll, but you can just feel it click as it moves, which
    I really like as a feedback mechanism. I haven&#8217;t tried the horizontal scrolling
    feature yet, since I&#8217;ve only been catching up with my email and what&#8217;s
    been happening on LJ. I think a bit of playing around with photographs in Photoshop
    is called for at some point today. Just for testing purposes you understand. [...]'

A further note in regard to the <a href="http://woss.name/2005/08/02/mighty-mouse/">new Apple mouse</a>.  From my boss:

<blockquote>I've ordered you a Mighty Mouse from the Apple Store.

A</blockquote>

w00t!  Hopefully it should be here in the next few days and I can tell you all about it. :-)
