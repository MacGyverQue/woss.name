After a weekend's hard graft, we now have the outline for an Order of Service for our wedding.  The basic structure is correctly laid out, we have chosen all the hymns, figured out the readings and tweaked most of the tweakable text.  It's all currently sitting in an <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">Omni Outliner</a> document (let's make use of all this software I've bought, eh?) while we create the structure and fill in the text, before being transferred to <a href="http://www.quark.com/products/xpress/" title="QuarkXPress">something</a> <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html" title="Adobe InDesign">else</a> for formatting and publication.  It has also been checked over by the priest who will be officiating, and apparently we've not made any major gaffes, which is a relief.

I suspect I'm not going to be allowed to tell you what we've chosen in advance, so you'll have to turn up on the day for the surprise. :-)  Since it's so close, yes, there will be a Christmas theme with the hymns, so bring along your best caroling voices!
