  content: Unfortunately Whittards are discontinuing the AA, which is most annoying.
    Other places do it, but they're very convenient.

  content: Aww, that's no good.  The Roast &amp; Post Coffee Company do it too, though,
    and it's not too inconvenient to order from there.  I generally just get it delivered
    to work and carry it home.  But you've got to order silly amounts for it to be
    cheaper than Whittards...

  content: <p>[...] I&#8217;ve been reading through the archives of a blog I stumbled
    upon a while back and came across an entry about coffee which mentioned it&#8217;s
    procurement via the internet. I love my coffee and have been a heavy consumer
    of it for many years (especially since I got into recovery) and when chosing a
    bean I always go for the strongest available, avoiding the different &#8220;blends&#8221;
    or &#8220;styles&#8221; that most supernmarkets offer. [...]</p>

I've just started the second bag of coffee from my birthday haul, which has been sitting in the freezer, keeping itself fresh for the past couple of weeks.  It's <a href="http://www.whittard.co.uk/cgi-bin/whittard.filereader?433cf35602222792273fc0a801830650+EN/products/150B">Guatemalan Elephant</a> from <a href="http://www.whittard.co.uk/">Whittard</a>.  A bit stronger than I'm used to  -- I haven't had the full cafeti&egrave;re yet, but already I can feel myself buzzing a bit -- but very tasty.  Perhaps it's one to only make in the 6-cup cafeti&egrave;re, rather than the 12-cup one I pulled out this morning!

Hmm, maybe I should start a theme.  Top-n things in the world ever.  So, let's see.  Top 5 coffees:

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.whittard.co.uk/cgi-bin/whittard.filereader?433cf35602222792273fc0a801830650+EN/products/5306B">Pico Duarte</a>  My absolute favourite coffee in the world ever.  It's the perfect balance of strength to wake me up in the morning, without putting me on edge.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.whittard.co.uk/cgi-bin/whittard.filereader?433cf35602222792273fc0a801830650+EN/products/138B">Kenya AA</a>  This is one that I was introduced to by <a href="http://www.sirena.org.uk/log/">Mark</a> while we were working in the same office.  It's got a fantastic flavour, but it's light enough that I can happily drink it all day.</li>
  <li>Pretty much anything from <a href="http://www.realcoffee.co.uk/products.asp?id=Origins">The Roast &amp; Post Coffee Company</a>.  Unfortunately, I tend to bulk order from this company, getting five or six packs which last for months (in the freezer they do last OK, but not perfectly).  Whatever I open first is absolutely the best, having been freshly roasted less than 24 hours before I consume the first cup.</li>
  <li>From recent experience, cafe hellenica (greek coffee).  OK, it's a method of preparation rather than a particular coffee, where the coffee and water (and, optionally, sugar, if that's your thing) is all heated together on the stove.  It produces a wonderful taste, which is slightly different from regular coffee, particularly the aftertaste.  Some may not like it so much, though, since the very finely ground coffee does end up at the bottom of your cup, so you have to be careful supping the dregs, or you wind up with a mouth full of powder!</li>
  <li>Whatever one I have first thing in the morning!  Frankly it can be instant and I'll be happy.  Just that first bite of coffee in the morning.  Mmmm.</li>
</ol>

OK, I'm grasping at straws towards the end.  There are more coffees I really enjoy, but it's too early in the morning to think of them just now. :-)
