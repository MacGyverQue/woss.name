  content: ! '[...] But gradually, I became dissatisfied with the ability to attach
    meta data to images. It&#8217;s awkward to add keywords in iPhoto (something which
    Keyword Assistant mitigates somewhat) and there&#8217;s insufficient access to
    meta data to append the kind of information I would like to apply to my images
    in a structured format. Add to that the fact that I&#8217;ve started to take my
    photography a little more &#8217;seriously&#8217;. I&#8217;ve got a shiny new
    camera and now I shoot in RAW format. Unfortunately, iPhoto doesn&#8217;t support
    the new Canon RAW (.CR2) format. And I&#8217;m unimpressed with iPhoto&#8217;s
    support for RAW images anyway. [...]'

This is what I have in the way of photography kit just now:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.canon.co.uk&#47;for_home&#47;product_finder&#47;cameras&#47;digital_slr&#47;eos_350d&#47;index.asp">Canon EOS 350D<&#47;a> (aka Digital Rebel XT) digital SLR camera.<&#47;li>
  <li>Canon <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.canon.co.uk&#47;for_home&#47;product_finder&#47;cameras&#47;ef_lenses&#47;zoom_lenses&#47;ef-s_18-55mm_f-3.5-5.6&#47;index.asp">EF-S 18-55mm f&#47;3.5-5.6 USM<&#47;a> lens (ie the default one that comes with the EOS 350D consumer kit).<&#47;li>
  <li>Canon <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.canon.co.uk&#47;for_home&#47;product_finder&#47;cameras&#47;ef_lenses&#47;zoom_lenses&#47;ef_75300mm_f456iii_usm&#47;index.asp">EF 75-300mm f&#47;4-5.6 III USM<&#47;a> lens.<&#47;li>
  <li>Canon <a href="http:&#47;&#47;consumer.usa.canon.com&#47;ir&#47;controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=141&modelid=7394">Speedlite 420EX<&#47;a> flash.<&#47;li>
  <li>A couple of Sandisk 512MB compact flash cards, one of which is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sandisk.com&#47;retail&#47;cf.asp">dog slow<&#47;a>; the other is just a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sandisk.com&#47;retail&#47;ultra2-cf.asp">bit slow<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
  <li>A velbon mini tripod<&#47;li>
  <li>Jessops-own floor-standing tripod, which maxes out at about 5 feet high.<&#47;li>
  <li>A circular polarising filter.<&#47;li>
  <li>Spare batteries.<&#47;li>
  <li>A bag to put it all in!<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

That's about it for now...  At some point in the not too distant future, I'd like to add a 50mm f&#47;1.8 lens to that arsenal for lower light&#47;portrait work, and some more (faster!) compact flash cards so I can take more than 130 shots between refills.  Oh, and a macro lens of some variety would rock somewhat. :)

Software-wise, I'm kinda up in the air just now.  That's the post I was about to write, but I figured I should start this category properly, by mentioning what kit I'm using.  So maybe the next post will be more about the software...
