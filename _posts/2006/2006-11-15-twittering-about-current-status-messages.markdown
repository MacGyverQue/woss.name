<img class="alignright" src="http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;dist&#47;fuzzy_logic.png" &#47;> I
discovered (via [Gruber](http:&#47;&#47;daringfireball.net&#47;) talking about
[Dunstan's](http:&#47;&#47;www.1976design.com&#47;) new job with Flickr) a new web
application called [Twitter](http:&#47;&#47;www.twitter.com&#47;). It allows you to write
short 'status' messages through a number of mechanisms, and to keep up with
other people's status messages in a similar manner. I can submit messages
directly through their web site, by IM (using Jabber&#47;GTalk) or by text
message, which means I can trivially update my status pretty much wherever I
am. I can also receive friends' status messages through all these mechanisms.

In practice, I can see it having a few practical purposes. I can effectively
have an accurate status message of where I am&#47;what I'm doing at all times,
plastered across my web page. I'm not sure I see the point in other people
being able to receive these messages on their mobile phones (for example). On
the other hand, being able to send a message (I'm off to the Regent for a
swift 'alf after work) being broadcast to my local friends could be a useful
feature should any of them fancy joining me there for a while...

I'm going to have a wee play around with it over the next couple of weeks and see what it's like.  The biggest barrier will be actually remembering to ever update it.  So, I don't suppose other people around here (particularly, as I say, people in my locality) fancy trying it out too?  You can find my profile here: <http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;mathie> and you can sign up here: <http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;account&#47;create>.

Smells to me like it's a [Rails](http:&#47;&#47;www.rubyonrails.org&#47;) app too...  I'd had in the back of my mind the idea of doing something similar.  I'd even gotten around to registering the domain name my-status.com after [Fraser Speirs](http:&#47;&#47;fraserspeirs.livejournal.com&#47;) talked about the idea of [personal status messages](http:&#47;&#47;fraserspeirs.livejournal.com&#47;1017529.html) back in March.  I'm glad somebody else has implemented it and saved me the bother!

Oh, the image has nothing to do with anything, I just thought Annabel would appreciate my little tweak to [today's Get Fuzzy](http:&#47;&#47;www.comics.com&#47;&#47;comics&#47;getfuzzy&#47;archive&#47;getfuzzy-20061115.html). :-)
