In an accidental discovery (I was actually looking for something <em>entirely</em> different, but I got distracted &mdash; more on that later, perhaps) I found [WebSVN](http://websvn.tigris.org/) which will once again allow me to make my subversion repository visible to the wider world.  I'd been waiting for my [happy hosters](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?wossname) to upgrade my machine to [Sarge](http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/) so that there was a shared installation of Subversion and that, perhaps, there'd be a non-ugly way of installing the Python bindings so I can use [ViewCVS](http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/).  But since I've found this, it'll do in the meantime.  It looks a little crufty to my untrained PHP-eye, but we'll see.

Anyway, you can now [browse my personal svn repository](http://woss.name/svn/) and see what I've been wasting my time starting but never finishing.  Most of the activity is because my home directory (shared amongst all the *nix hosts I have a login on and trust the admins) is stored in there.
