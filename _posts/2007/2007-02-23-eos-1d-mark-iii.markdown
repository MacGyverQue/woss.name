    be an interesting camera.</p>


    <p>The D is the fast, newspaper/sports-type camera; the Ds is the quality one.
    Mike Johnston''s prediction of a 22mp full-frame 1DsmkIII surely can''t be too
    far off the eventual mark. And <i>that</i> will be the real 1Ds replacement.</p>


    <p>The 3" screen is mighty nice, though.</p>'

  content: ! '<p>tom: Ah, yes, a very good point.  Compared to the 1D Mk II it''s
    a very nice revision.</p>


    <p>My hopes are for a 1Ds Mk III which has the quality we''d expect from a top-of-the-range
    Canon, but actually revises the user interface to be more in line with the consumer-level
    cameras.  I''ve had a shot of a 1Ds Mk II a couple of times now and I found the
    UI to be <em>really</em> clunky and awkward.  OK, part of that was that the buttons
    weren''t in exactly the same place, but ISTR having to use strange combinations
    of buttons that required more dexterity than I was capable of when I was trying
    to concentrate on shooting great photos.</p>'

  content: <p>It does sound really nice. However I'm with mathie on the lust factor
    for a full frame camera. I've only just gotten my EOS 400D and I'm starting knocking
    up the wish list for it's replacement.</p>

  content: ! '<p>Hmn... no, I think the 1D interface is fine for its target market;
    the "important" stuff, from my memory of one hands-on, is under your fingers;
    modal-settings that are less likely to change are not. It places the emphasis
    on just shooting pictures, rather than fiddling.</p>


    <p>I personally don''t like the control layout hugely, but it''s not that bad,
    and I think it fits its target market well. Out of all the Canons I''ve looked
    at, the 20D/30D felt the best: the right size, right number of buttons, and the
    wheel on the back - the Rebel-types are really crippled by the lack of that rear
    dial.</p>


    <p>But hey, I''m a Nikon man, and I think their interface is streets ahead of
    Canon''s button-heavy one ;)</p>'

Ooh, shiny!  Canon yesterday announced the release of the [Canon EOS-1D Mark III](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=14999).    Interestingly, it doesn't have the 16.7 megapixel full frame sensor of the 1Ds Mk II, but a 10.1 megapixel APS-H one which gives you a 1.3x conversion factor.  I guess that's how they've brought the price down (just looking at Jessops, the 1Ds Mk II retails at about Â£4,500 where the Mk III is on pre-order at Â£3,000).  However, it does record 14 bits per pixel, rather than the usual 12, so the tonal range is vastly better.  It has the neat sensor cleaning system that first appeared in the 400D.  I particularly like that it's got a nice big buffer for continuous shooting, letting you shoot 10fps for 30 raw frames (or 110 jpegs).

First thoughts?  I want to nab a second hand 1Ds Mk II from somebody who's upgrading.  Other than that, I think I'd rather have a 5D.  I (probably irrationally or ignorantly) like the idea of a full-frame sensor.
