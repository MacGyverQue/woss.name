[My Dream App](http:&#47;&#47;mydreamapp.com&#47;) is a competition run by four talented indie Mac developers.  People propose their dream application for the Mac that's currently missing, the public votes on their favourite and the developers implement it.

It sounds to me like a winner all round: the developers get to create an application which they *know* will sell well (the winner had something in the region of 6,500 votes, which ought to be an indicator towards the number of copies they'll sell pretty quickly after it's released?).  The proposer gets to see their dream application developed, *and* get royalties from its sale.  And us mere Mac users get to see new applications created which we want.

It's also a stunning marketing exercise, though the tough part is going to be keeping the momentum going between now and the winners being released.

So the [winners have been announced](http:&#47;&#47;mydreamapp.com&#47;news&#47;post&#47;347&#47;).  And the two I voted for made it into second and third place!  I'm really thrilled by the idea of [Portal](http:&#47;&#47;mydreamapp.com&#47;contestants&#47;view&#47;farzadsadjadi&#47;) which will allow me to synchronise documents, settings and, well, hopefully everything in the world ever amongst several computers.  This is going to be an amazing application for me since I regularly work between two computers -- my laptop when I'm on the road and my G5 desktop in the office (aka the spare bedroom at home!) -- and I'm really looking forward to its release.  I imagine it's going to be a tough problem to solve well though.

Nobody seemed interested in my initial idea: a Usenet News reader which actually focused on reading and participating in conversations, rather than leeching content from binary groups.  Oh well.
