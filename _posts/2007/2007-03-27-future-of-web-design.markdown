A friend of mine bought a ticket for the Future of Web Design conference in London but has now discovered he can't make it.  (Which has nothing to do with the fact that I'm currently his team lead and our project is running to a tight schedule, honest!)  You can go offer to take the ticket off his hands here: [Go to the Future of Web Design Conference](http:&#47;&#47;beer-monkey.com&#47;2007&#47;3&#47;27&#47;go-to-the-future-of-web-design-conference).
