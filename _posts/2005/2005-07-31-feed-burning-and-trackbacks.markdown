OK, that's the feeds replaced with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.feedburner.com&#47;">Feedburner's<&#47;a> 'SmartFeed', which is supposed to allow me some interesting statistics, and make sure that every client who requests a feed gets what is most suitable for it (be it RSS or Atom in their various incarnations).  I'll play with it anyway, see how well it works.

And trackbacks (or pingbacks or whatever they are called) are insanely cool.  I'd never really seen them in action before.  After the last post mentioning all the wp plugins I'm using, I now have excerpts of the post on some of the pages I linked to!  Way neat.
