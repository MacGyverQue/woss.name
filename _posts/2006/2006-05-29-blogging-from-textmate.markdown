I noticed this afternoon that there's a new bundle for [TextMate](http:&#47;&#47;www.macromates.com&#47;) from [Brad Choate](http:&#47;&#47;www.bradchoate.com&#47;) which implements a blog client.  Neat!  I suspect this was about the only major text-editing thing I don't yet do with TextMate.  And I'm always typing snippets and random shortcuts from TM in other applications anyway.  So here's me testing it...
