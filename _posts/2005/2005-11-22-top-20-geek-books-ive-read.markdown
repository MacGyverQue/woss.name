  content: ! 'Agreed.


    As far as Iain M Banks is considered, you should pick up the Culture books, if
    nothing else: Consider Phleabas, Player of Games, Use of Weapons, State of the
    Art (Novella), Excession and Look to Windward...


    And if you''re in the mood for some really thick books for next year''s reading,
    try the Night''s Dawn Trilogy by Peter F Hamilton.  3 volumes at 1500 pages apiece...
    and it''s a bloody good story, too... :-)

  content: ! '<p>I got started on "The Illuminatus trilogy" two times already, but
    I must agree that it''s almost unreadable. It''s so incredibly messy, switching
    back and forth between settings and characters.

    Another book by Douglas Coupland I highly recommend is JPod, often described as
    "Microserfs for the Google-age".<&#47;p>'

The Guardian Online have an article on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.guardian.co.uk&#47;technology&#47;archives&#47;2005&#47;11&#47;09&#47;top_20_geek_novels_the_results.html">Top 20 geek novels<&#47;a>, surveying the best of the 'geek' novels written in English since 1932.  The results are as follows, with the ones I have read highlighted in bold:

<ol class="compact">
<li><strong>The HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy -- Douglas Adams<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li><strong>Nineteen Eighty-Four -- George Orwell<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li>Brave New World -- Aldous Huxley<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? -- Philip Dick<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li><strong>Neuromancer -- William Gibson<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li>Dune -- Frank Herbert<&#47;li>
<li><strong>I, Robot -- Isaac Asimov<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li><strong>Foundation -- Isaac Asimov<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li><strong>The Colour of Magic -- Terry Pratchett<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li><strong>Microserfs -- Douglas Coupland<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li><strong>Snow Crash -- Neal Stephenson<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li>Watchmen -- Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Cryptonomicon -- Neal Stephenson<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li>Consider Phlebas -- Iain M Banks<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Stranger in a Strange Land -- Robert Heinlein<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li>The Man in the High Castle -- Philip K Dick<&#47;li>
<li><strong>American Gods -- Neil Gaiman<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li><strong>The Diamond Age -- Neal Stephenson<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li>The Illuminatus! Trilogy -- Robert Shea & Robert Anton Wilson<&#47;li>
<li>Trouble with Lichen - John Wyndham<&#47;li>
<&#47;ol>

I did try reading The Illuminatus! Trilogy -- really, I did.  But it's just, well, in my humble opinion, unreadable.  Completely deranged, switching from one scene (or narrative) to another with nary a paragraph break.  OK, perhaps I should give it another chance sometime, that maybe reading it while I was commuting regularly between Edinburgh and Milton Keynes wasn't the best time to try.  But I'd have to be really desperate to consider it!  I really should get around to trying some of Iain Bank's sci-fi stuff sometime.  I've read most of his other novels, but the only Iain <em>M<&#47;em> Banks novel I've ever read is State of the Art.
