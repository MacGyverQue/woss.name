  content: ! 'Shame there''s no Windows version... (ducks the thrown objects from
    the Mac users).  I''ve just started looking around at Backup options myself (only
    2 or so years since I promised myself I''d sort out something concrete for my
    PCs) - I''m currently pondering an external HDD (although I''m not sure whether
    to use it as additional storage or a pure backup device).  At the moment the problem
    seems to be finding an enclosure with all the features I want (USB2 and Firewire
    access, backup button, not limtied to 250GB) for a reasonable price - best balance
    I''ve found so far is a Maxtor OneTouchII 300GB from Amazon for Â£141.  Or perhaps
    I should forego the backup button and do it via software like everyone else...
    :-)

  content: I've got a 160GB original Maxtor OneTouch which has both USB and Firewire,
    which works reasonably well, and I intend to start doing offsite backups with
    it at some point.  But the main backup disk I'm using is a <a href="http://www.seagate.com/products/retail/external/usbfirewire"
    rel="nofollow">Seagate 280GB USB/Firewire disk</a>.  I did also see that Staples
    (in Teeside Park) was doing an offer on <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10511"
    rel="nofollow">LaCie d2 500GB</a> drives for &pound;200.  It doesn't have the
    one-touch backup button, but they get a good reputation in the Mac community and
    it seems a reasonable price to me.

  content: ! 'Hmmm, that is pretty good - especially considering that the cheapest
    500GB internal IDE drive that Scan.co.uk do is Â£235.  And it includes a Firewire800
    interface, too.  Although a friend of mine''s Lacie failed after about a month''s
    use - annoying, but the worst part was that it took them 6 weeks to sort out the
    problem.


    I''ve read reviews of the Seagate that were less than flattering, in terms of
    poor performance (speedwise).


    I''ll have to have a think - I was thinking that the Maxtor was a bit pricey at
    Â£141 (given an enclosure + 300GB drive would cost Â£115), but for 500GB capacity...

  content: ! 'Unfortunately, the LaCie drive in Staples is this one: <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10450"
    rel="nofollow">Big Disk</a> - it''s 2x250GB HDDs in a single casing, with a single
    USB2 connector.  It''s still a good deal, but I''m wondering if you''d be better
    off picking up a pair of 250GB multi-connection drives, if you can get them for
    Â£100 each or less - if you plug them into different hubs, would you get twice
    the data transfer rate...?

OK, so over the holidays I finally developed a new, exciting habit: backing up my laptop.  I still haven't worked it into a regular schedule, but having a week old backup is better than none at all, I suppose!

I'm using <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a>on my laptop to make regular backups to an external Firewire disk.  I had started simply by using SuperDuper to back up my laptop prior to nuking everything and reinstalling, but I've continued to use it since.  I back up to a sparse disk image on the firewire drive which, while not bootable, means I'm not using the entire 280GB drive to back up a 100GB disk in the laptop.  At some point I should repartition that drive so that I can back straight to another disk and make it bootable, leaving another partition of 80GB for my desktop machine and the remainder for my <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a> file vault.

Anyway, this isn't so much of a how-to or what-I-should-do, but a recommendation of SuperDuper!  It's really easy to use -- creating my first complete backup took only a couple of clicks -- fast and I've successfully used it for restoring data too.  It does have a 'smart update' feature which reduces backup times -- from nearly 2 hours to around 15 minutes in my case -- by copying only the data that has changed since the last backup.

Dead simple, it Just Works, and it lowers the barrier to getting around to doing backups.  What better can be said for backup software?
