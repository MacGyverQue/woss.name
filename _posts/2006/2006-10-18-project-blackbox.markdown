Oh, wow.  Sun's latest announcement is [Project Blackbox](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox/index.jsp), a datacentre in a shipping container.  You just need to supply it with power, water and an Internet connection, then it becomes an entire datacentre, with up to 250 Sun T1000s, or 125 T2000s in 7 racks, with an 8th rack containing network infrastructure, security and thermal management units.

Or, let's think about it another way.  You could fit something in the region of 60 [Thumpers](http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4500/) in that space.  And each Thumper will give you up to 24TB of storage.  That's about 1,500TB (1.5PB?) of storage sitting in a parking space in the corner of your office car park.

I wonder if they allow you to [try and buy](http://www.sun.com/tryandbuy/) one...  We've got room in the back garden. :-)
