Currently being delivered (well, sometime in the next hour or so), from our local Indian Restaurant, the Shish Mahal, is:

<ul>
  <li>Vegetable Pakora.</li>
  <li>Mushroom Pakora.  The dips that come with the pakora are particularly lovely from here.  I've never tried the mushroom pakora before...</li>
  <li>Nawabi Bhindi Gosht.  We've had this one a couple of times before.  The menu describes it as <q>Lamb cooked with herbs and spices, fresh bhindi (okra) and fresh coriander -- medium to hot taste.</q>  I'm not normally a fan of lady's fingers, but they're pretty good in this one, and the sauce is just wonderful.  Just the right spiciness.</li>
  <li>Sabzi Pasanda.  Annabel has had this dish <em>every time we've ordered from there</em>.  I can see why -- it's fantastic -- and I'll certainly be nicking a bit of it!  <q>Fresh mixed vegetables cooked with tomato and fresh cream to create a slightly sour taste.</q></li>
  <li>Saffron rice</li>
  <li>Garlic and coriander nan bread.</li>
</ul>

My tummy is rumbling with anticipation!  Though I suspect it won't be for long, and that there will be plenty left over for breakfast tomorrow!
