Since the market has been unbelievably slow in Edinburgh, but is apparently picking back up again, we're making a last-ditch attempt to sell our old flat before putting it on the market to rent.  So it's back on the market at the bargain-basement price of Offers Over &pound;69,000.

Details are available from the [ESPC web site](http://www.espc.com/): [31/1 Easter Road, Edinburgh, EH7 5PJ](http://www.espc.com/EspcPublic/UniversalPages/PropertyDetails.aspx?rid=182777).  We're doing viewings again, every Thursday from 19:00 to 21:00, and Sunday between 14:00 and 16:00.  Since the flat is completely empty -- no furniture, no coffee making facilities, no Internet access -- I'd really appreciate people turning up to look at the place!  You can see exactly where it is (and how convenient it is for both the City Centre &amp; Leith!) [here](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=55.959255,-3.171680&hl=en).

Contact the solicitors (linked from the ESPC page) to arrange a viewing or for more details.  Or you can just contact Annabel and [me](mailto:mathie@woss.name) directly.
