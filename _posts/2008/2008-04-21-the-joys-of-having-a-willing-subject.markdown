    and crop a little.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31634770@N00/2425310916" title="View 'Fortune Teller' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2050/2425310916_8ecb1056b7_m.jpg" alt="Fortune Teller" border="0" width="240" height="240" class="alignleft" /></a> I've decided that one of the best things about having kids is that now I've got a willing subject for taking photographs.  While his mummy was off getting a haircut on Saturday morning, we both decided it would be a great idea to play around with the camera and an off-camera flash.

I'm rather pleased with the outcome of a few of these shots -- click on the image to be taken through to a larger size and a few other shots.  I've had lots of comments about this one being creepy or scary, which I don't *quite* get.  I think it looks really cute and he's just being *interested* in the flash.  (In reality he's sitting on his rug in the living room on a Saturday morning, trying to lean forward and grab the slave flash unit (a Canon SpeedLite 420EX) sitting on the floor in front of him while I'm firing off shots around him.

Anyway, just to prove I can talk about things other than git. :-)
