<img src="http://woss.name/dist/railsconf-europe-attendee.png" class="alignleft" /> [RailsConf Europe](http://europe.railsconf.org/) has been announced.  Have you booked your place yet?  I have.  :-)  And I'm looking forward to it already!  I haven't organised any accommodation or travel yet -- I should really do that further in advance this time...

Generate your own [ajax loader icons](http://www.ajaxload.info/) here.  I'm still wanting to capture the spinning beach ball from Mac OS X to use as an indicator instead. :)

And I've just started using the Party Shuffle feature on iTunes, with a slightly restricted playlist (basically anything tagged in the comments with 'owner: mathie' and 'type: album' so I don't get singles or have to put up with Annabel's questionable taste in music! :-P ).  I'm getting to listen to all sorts of stuff I haven't heard in a while, stuff I wouldn't normally think to listen to.  (For example, I'd forgotten I even owned Bernard Butler's first solo album!)  You can see today's eclectic selection on [my last.fm profile](http://www.last.fm/user/mathie_wossname).  And maybe it'll stop me listening to Placebo quite so much!

Ach, back to contract negotiations, wrestling [pythons](http://www.python.org/) for [Oxfam International](http://www.oxfam.org/) and, well, nothing much to do with Ruby on Rails, really.  Still, contracts means money and that's what I'm doing this for, right?  Right!
