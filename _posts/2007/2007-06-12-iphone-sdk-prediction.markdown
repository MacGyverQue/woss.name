So, the [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) doesn't have a specific Software Development Kit (SDK) as such.  You just create web applications and they'll happily work on it.  Most excellent!  I'll be able to target the iPhone with the technologies I already know (I never got the hang of Cocoa).

Well, based on that, here's my prediction (which isn't exactly too far fetched, I don't think): the iPhone and [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com/) are a match made in heaven.  The iPhone will ship with Google Gears built in.

(If I'm right, I want an iPhone as a prize!)
