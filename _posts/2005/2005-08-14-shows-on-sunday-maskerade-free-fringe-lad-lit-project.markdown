Last Sunday, we saw a few shows at the <a href="http://www.edfringe.com/" title="Edinburgh Fringe Festival">Fringe</a>.  It's taken me a week, but here are some notes...

<h2>Maskerade</h2>

The first show we saw was <a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=MASK">Terry Pratchett's Maskerade</a>, performed at C Electric (the old Odeon on Nicholson Street) .  It was true to the book, very funny, the acting was superb.  Particularly the witches.  And, completely unexpectedly, the singing was good too.  (I had expected it to be hammed up and deliberately awful.)

<h2>Free Fringe @ Canon's Gait</h2>

Since we had a bit of time to kill between shows and we overheard this being mentioned, we popped into the Canon's Gait (on the Royal Mile) to see <a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=FREEF">The Free Fringe</a>, which hosts daily freebie stand up comedy shows.  It's worth every penny!  The first guy was quite funny, making light of the fact that he constantly shakes.  (<q>Do you have multiple sclerosis, mate?  Nah, just the one.</q>)  He played well to the audience, considering their number and desire for participation.  Next up was a bloke from Airdrie.  I suspect I 'got' more of the humour than the rest of the audience from being born & brought up in that locality.  The last act?  I can't even remember, just that he was dire and barely got a laugh.

<h2>The Lad Lit Project</h2>

Our last show of the afternoon was <a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=LADLI">The Lad Lit Project</a>, a study of how the male brain works.  It was a one man show, a 30-something obsessive-compulsive bloke who was using insight from his own life, and that of the people he'd interviewed, to show how the male mind works.  Some of it was scarily accurate (<q>Reads comic books, but insists they are <em>graphic novels</em></q> got a laugh from Annabel), some of it was just bizarre.  I did like that, near the end, when he was lining up the chairs, that he got them exactly right, just as I would have done (lined up against some joins between the mats on the stage).  It was a little long, though.  And the point where he was reciting a list of characteristics just got boring about a third of the way through.
