For the first time in my life, I have bought music online (in a downloadable format; I've bought CDs from Amazon before...).  I was introduced to <a href="http://www.allofmp3.com/">AllOfMP3</a> by <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/broonie/">Broonie</a> (who learned about it from <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/render/">Render</a>) this morning and decided to give it a whirl.  It's <em>incredibly</em> cheap -- tracks are charged by the bandwidth consumed downloading them and so far I'm averaging $0.12 per track!  So I loaded my account up with $10 (less than &pound;6) and have managed to acquire:

<ul>
  <li>Devin Townsend -- Ocean Machine</li>
  <li>Depeche Mode -- Playing The Angel</li>
  <li>Franz Ferdinand -- You Could Have It So Much Better</li>
  <li>Kaiser Chiefs -- Employment</li>
  <li>New Order -- Singles (which I'm currently listening to)</li>
</ul>

Not bad for a morning's haul.  The speed downloading stuff is exceptionally good -- I was saturating my 2Mb/s before heading to work, and whatever work's connection was afterwards. :-)  I suspect I'll be spending a few more bucks there sometime soon...
