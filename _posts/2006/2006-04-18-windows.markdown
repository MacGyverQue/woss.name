  content: ! '<p>Well... there aren''t really Quicksilver of TextMate replacements.</p>


    <p>I''ve tried and tried and tried, and I haven''t found a Windows text editor
    that isn''t weird and crufty.</p>


    <p>I finally settled on "jEdit" as my default editor (for when I''m not in Visual
    Studio, which is most of the time anyway.)</p>


    <p>http://www.jedit.org/</p>


    <p>For launching stuff, I always disable the "Quick Launch Tray" on the taskbar
    and replace it with "Free Launch Bar":

    http://www.freelaunchbar.com/</p>


    <p>It''s pretty much like Quick Launch, except you can create folders that act
    as pull-down menus; I throw all my common shortcuts to apps and folders in there
    and rarely have to dig through the start menu.</p>


    <p>For RSS, well, I just use BlogLines since I use too many different machines
    in a day to want to look up all my subs on NNW on my iBook.</p>


    <p>I also drag the TaskBar to the top and lock it (right click for the option.)
    I guess that''s more "OS 9" than "OS X" though.</p>'

  content: <p>TextPad I use sometimes, and notepad2 is a nice, really lightweight
    option.  Notepad   a lot of people like, but it's crap auto indenting annoys me.  A
    lot of people really like ultraEdit, but I've not used it much myself.  There's
    also editplus and scintilla which I've played about with, but not used enough
    to say much about.</p>

OK, so you're on site doing some work and you're pretty much coerced into using Windows.  How do you trick it out to make life less painful, particularly for the Mac addict?  Is there an equivalent of [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/)?  What's closest to [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)?  I've already grabbed [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/) and all the requisite extensions, so at least I'm feeling at home in a web browser. :)

Hopefully, we can arrange to get my laptop setup on the network here, since it's a regular gig (I'm redeveloping the [Behind the Medical Headlines](http://www.behindthemedicalheadlines.com/) web site for the [Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh](http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/)), since until then I don't really have access to my own email while I'm in this office!  Fortunately, I do still have access to [support@rubaidh.com](mailto:support@rubaidh.com) and [sales@rubaidh.com](mailto:sales@rubaidh.com) though!

**Update** what do all the cool kids use for RSS on Windows?  I feel like I'm half-deaf without NetNewsWire!
