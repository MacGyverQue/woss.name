  content: ! '<p>The messy desk picture will definitely make a return -- sometime
    today, I hope -- along with a couple of other missing features that haven''t been
    ported across yet.<&#47;p>


    <p>I was thinking of creating a new picture, with the up-to-date desk, but it''s
    currently not messy enough!  I''m sure it will be by the end of the week, though!<&#47;p>'

I'm partway through updating the theme on this site to the latest beta of [K2](http:&#47;&#47;binarybonsai.com&#47;wordpress&#47;k2).  I think it's looking much prettier so far, but there's still some customisation to be reintegrated (like all revenue-generating Google ads, and the picture of a messy desk, which really ought to be updated anyway!).  What do you think?  Does it look OK on your browser?
