    It''s really good.  It focuses mainly on film (but it may have changed since my
    edition which came out in 1988 I think), but I can use the bulk of what''s there
    with my D50.  It''s cheap, too.'

  content: ! 'I''m very much in the same boat as you.  I just picked up a new Canon
    30D so I have no excuses as to why I would be producing bad shots.  I picked up
    [Understanding Exposure](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0817463003/qid=1149054810/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-3219409-8476905?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155)
    and it''s been an outstanding book.


    It was just the type of learning I needed to understand.  A lot of the questions
    you bring up are described in the book (albeit some inderectly appliable). I also
    picked up [Mastering Digital Photography](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1598630172/qid=1149054987/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-3219409-8476905?v=glance&amp;s=books
    ) ... I haven''t started reading it yet, but it''s gotten some pretty good reviews
    from Amazon readers.'

  content: ! '<p>It sounds like you are quite keen on using flash which gives you
    a number of options.  Whilst I have lots of fancy flash kit (550EX, 580EX and
    some work studio lights), you really dont need it or want it if you are planning
    on learning technique.</p>


    <p>The best thing you could do, is buy some old fashioned manual flash units.  I''d
    suggest Vivitar 283 or 285 flashes or similar.  They have a zoom, thyristor power
    control and one hell of an output power for the price.  Make sure you go for the
    HV models as they have a lower voltage on the flash pins and thus are safer with
    digital cameras.  Details are here: http://www.botzilla.com/photo/strobeVolts.html  To
    be extra safe, I recommend the Wein HSHS safe sync http://www.weinproducts.com/safesyncs.htm
    and http://www.theflashcentre.com/item.do?item=358 This protects the camera and
    also allows you to connect a pc cord to the flash giving you an extra cheap off
    camera lead (usually a couple of quid).  You may also want a flash slave trigger
    to play with multiple flashes by triggering one remotely.  Most of this stuff
    can be picked up second hand.  You should get change from Â£100, even with the
    expensive safe sync</p>


    <p>Once you have some manual flashes, I aslo recommend a light meter.  I have
    managed with the histogram on the Canon when I havent had a meter with me but
    it''s not the easiest way to do things and only shows you overall exposure.  For
    a meter, I recommend Sekonic.  I have the 358 having upgraded from the 308 (both
    are now around the same price) http://www.onestop-digital.com/catalog/product_info.php?currency=GBP&amp;products_id=112</p>


    <p>A flash meter will allow you to balance ambient and flash as it can take both
    flash and ambient readings simultaneously.  You can control exactly the difference
    in exposure between background and foreground.  The trick is to use the camera
    on manual, expose for the background and adjust the settings on the flash to control
    the balance.  The flash power relates only to its power switch and to the camera
    aperture as the flash pulse should be faster then your shutter speed.</p>


    <p>Other fun things with manual flash include playing with colour filters (see
    http://lostamerica.com/ for some amazing examples) and high speed photography
    of water drops etc.</p>


    <p>A fancy Canon flash will allow you manual control but will probably cost twice
    the price of all the kit above put together.  The Canon gear is great for wireless
    flash control and auto exposure if you want to point and shoot (e.g. photojournalist
    mode, weddings etc) but you wont learn as much)</p>


    <p>The light meter should help you with difficult scenes too.  It measures the
    light falling on the subject rather than that reflected so the tones in the image
    should be captured properly.  Unfortunately, the Canon cameras lack a good spot
    metering function which would allow you to experiment with the zone system.  The
    histogram does, however, provide good indication and bracketing no longer wastes
    film.  I often shoot bracketed on continuous drive mode as it also gives you the
    chance to build HDR images in photoshop and adjust exposure and local contrast
    later.</p>


    <p>As for the action shots, go for an open aperture on your new 50mm f1.8 and
    pan the camera on a reasonably long shutter speed. You can practice by shooting
    cars out the window and tracking the motion.  Alternatively, pan with a quick
    burst of flash for a similar effect.</p>


    <p>For some inspiration, try http://www.dpchallenge.com  I keep meaning to submit
    some entries when I have some non-diy time!  You may also want to join the Edinburgh
    Photographic Society at http://www.edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk/ If you
    want to try anything specific, let me know as I''m happy to go out and take photos
    with you and give you any advice I can offer.  I used to do some professional
    photography - mainly reportage and music whilst I was at university and have had
    lots of experience of different techniques when I was involved in running various
    photographic clubs.  I can also sneak you into the EPS darkroom if you want to
    try your hand at black and white film.</p>


    <p>Finally, the only real tip I learnt from the real pros when I was shooting
    music is to take as many shots as possible.  Typically, they expect only one shot
    in a 36 exposure film to be of the required quality for a photo desk but try different
    apertures, shutter speeds, flash modes etc to try and capture ''the shot''.  Overnight
    I went from shooting one roll in the first three songs of a band to around 10
    rolls and suddenly the photos I took significantly improved, both from practice
    and being selective</p>'

    <p>A suggestion that brings to mind Jeremy Voorhis quote from Trey Anastasio.("Finding
    C from anywhere on the Guitar")</p>


    <p>I dont know how this would work in the digital realm, but with a film camera,
    you can do this easily.</p>


    <p>Pick one aperture and one shutter speed that suits the biggest portion of what
    you want to shoot, and then always and only shoot with this setting, it will be
    limiting and freeing at the same time, and then process your own film.  Refine
    your shots and your processing until you are making perfect exposures,  once you
    have things down in this structured environment it will be easy to calculate (even
    in your head) how to deal with other situations when you are shooting.</p>


    <p>Exposure is math,  you just need to know the equation by heart.</p>'

  content: ! '<p>Thanks for all your helpful responses!  Practicing is something I''m
    definitely doing, but what I''m currently feeling is that I''d like to know more
    about the techniques I should be attempting to practice.  I shall be taking a
    trip to Borders this afternoon to look through the recommended books and see what
    I fancy.</p>


    <p>Tim: fantastic post, thanks!  I''m definitely interested in playing with flash
    more seriously, but I think I''m going to concentrate on natural light while I''ve
    got the advantage of the long summer evenings.  I''ll definitely return to your
    comment in September/October and start playing around with flash in more detail.  For
    now, I must keep convincing myself that the Speedlite 420EX I''ve got will do
    the job for now. :)</p>


    <p><a href="http://lostamerica.com/" rel="nofollow">Lost America</a>?  Wow!  That''s
    absolutely stunning stuff!</p>


    <p>And yes, I always work on the basis of shooting lots, trying different variations
    on exposure, framing differently.  I doubt I''ve got a success rate of 1/36 though!  One
    thing I''ve found useful, particularly when shooting people or animals is to shoot
    in drive mode and always squeeze off two or three at a time.  People in particular
    tend to look more natural after the initial shot...</p>'

  content: ! '<p>I stumbled across your blog while looking for books on photography
    technique. Some of the best books I''ve read on photography theory have absolutely
    no technical details.</p>


    <p>Any book  that covers aperture, depth of field, iso speed and shutter speed
    isn''t going to help you. You should have a thorough understanding of that before
    you go on.</p>


    <p>Also, photography takes time. You have to understand all of the technicalities
    before you can begin to enjoy theory.</p>


    <p>The next time you go to Barnes and Noble, look in the photo technique section.
    You sound like someone new to the photography world. Look for books that offer
    introductory lessons. There are plenty.</p>


    <p>Forget buying an expensive camera. I''ve seen to many people who purchase 1000$
    cameras and wind up not knowing how to shoot.</p>


    <p>The camera won''t make you. You make the camera. Anyone can press the shutter
    button.</p>


    <p>Also...look for vintage books, not available in barnes and noble. It seems
    as though these focus more on technique and theory.</p>'

I've been getting quite into photography over the past couple of years.  Personally, I think I'm getting pretty good, but I'd like to be able to consistently produce excellent results, both in terms of technique and composition.  So how do I go about learning 'properly'?

I picked up [Basic Photography](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0240515927) by Michael Langford quite a while back -- probably getting on for a year or so.  I've made a couple of attempts to read it, but I'm having difficulty getting past the film camera bias.  Of course, most of the techniques are transitive but I still find it somewhat difficult to see beyond the film side of it.

I do know *some* theory: I understand the relationship between aperture and shutter speed; the relationship between aperture and depth of field.  I've got a vague idea about using fill-in flash.

What I'd like to learn how to do, off-hand?  Learn how to use flash to highlight a foreground (say a person) while correctly exposing a night-time background.  Correctly expose 'difficult' scenes without just trial-and error.  Light trails.  Fast action shots (say capturing the moving foreground, motion-blurring the background).

More than anything, though, I just want to produce consistently good photographs with less of a trial-and-error component.

So, can anybody recommend a photography book which teaches theory in a manner which is more accessible for digital users?  Or a web site?  Or, given my recent excellent experience of training with an expert, I don't suppose anybody knows of a pro photographer that wants to take me under their wing? :)
