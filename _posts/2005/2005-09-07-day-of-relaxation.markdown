It's nice to have a day off once in a while, when everybody else is out working.  I get to slob around, relax, read all the lovely birthday cards the postman delivered this morning, eat sausages &amp; hash browns for breakfast, drink freshly brewed coffee, start reading the copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316725234/mathieoftheen-21">All Fun and Games Until Somebody Loses an Eye</a> that I unwrapped today in bed and just generally, well, relax.

Well, mostly.  I'm also on the laptop, mucking around with Rails and posting here.  Some people just don't know <em>how</em> to relax, eh? :)

Last night was spent frenetically cleaning the entire house, since I wasn't going to do it today (it's a holiday, damnit!) and it needs doing before all the parentals in the world ever turn up on Friday evening and the place was turning into a wee bit of a disaster area.  And, whilst doing so, sampling a lovely Leffe beer I hadn't tried before: <a href="http://www.silrubin.com/leffe_radieuse.htm">Leffe Radieuse</a>.  It came in a promotional pack we picked up at Costco last weekend, containing one of each of the Leffe beers, along with two glasses.  OK, I've now gotten distracted, trying to take a photograph of one of the glasses alongside the Radieuse bottle.  So far, I've taken 46 shots, arranged on a variety of surfaces &amp; backgrounds, trying out different lenses &amp; techniques.  They're downloading from the camera (and being converted to DNG format) just now...
