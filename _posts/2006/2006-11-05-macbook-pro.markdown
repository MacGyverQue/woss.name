  content: <p>I had something similar happen at Apple and they were true to their
    word when I went back. When I bought my wife's Powerbook a couple of years ago,
    I was told it came with some software that it turned out was not included. When
    I went back to the store, the salesman admitted his mistake and gave me the software
    for free. They won my trust with their honesty. I've spent about $4000 at that
    store since.</p>

I finally succumbed.  I am the proud owner of a 17" Macbook Pro.  Not the shiniest, newest Core 2 Duo one, but the previous model.  See, I popped into [Scotsys](http://www.scotsys.co.uk/) in Glasgow yesterday afternoon, fully intending to buy the latest one if they had it in stock.  They didn't, but they were offering Â£200 off the old one, *plus* upgrading the memory to 2GB.  That still makes it a much sweeter machine than my old laptop and a little bit cheaper (or maybe including a new iPod in the deal...!).

So I went for it.

When I got home, I noticed that the box looked distinctly untampered with since it was shipped from Apple, and mentioned only 1GB of RAM.  Suspicious, I thought.  My suspicions were right, it does only have 1GB of RAM.

Bother.

I wouldn't have bought the machine if they hadn't told me there was 2GB of RAM in there -- that was a deal breaker.  So now I'm in the interesting situation of having to return it to the store, and ask for the extra memory.  Only the receipt doesn't explicitly say anything about extra RAM.  I can envisage this being a my-word-against-yours scenario.  I suppose worst-case, I should be able to return the machine for a refund, right?  And then reorder from somewhere else?

Still, assuming we get this sorted out, it's a lovely machine.  In particular, [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/) totally rocks.  I've already got images for Vista RC1, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and [Nexenta GNU/OpenSolaris](http://www.gnusolaris.org/) installed.  (Not running simultaneously mind, since I'm a bit low on RAM!)

We shall see how it progresses over the next few days.

**Update** Well, I phoned this morning, and I've to pop into the store for my RAM upgrade -- no problem at all.  [Scotsys](http://www.scotsys.co.uk/) were totally helpful and accommodating.  There is a side-issue that the Edinburgh branch doesn't reopen until tomorrow afternoon, but it's more convenient to wait 'til then than head back through to Glasgow again...
