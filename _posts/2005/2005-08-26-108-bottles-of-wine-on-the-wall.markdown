  content: Oh, um, er, that's not what I meant.  Whatever you think <em>that<&#47;em>
    is!  It mostly involves glue and unbrokened things. And forgiven cats?

  content: ! 'Mended <strong>them<&#47;strong>, even.  Well, hopefully.  Actually
    the shell was easier to attack with the UHU glue than eggie''s high chair -- I''m
    not sure that''s stuck properly yet.  Maybe it''s too porous.


    And anyway, they didn''t <em>mean<&#47;em> it -- Tiko''s just a bit clumsy and
    it''s our own fault anyway ''cos we basically encouraged him to climb up there
    by putting the boxes in front as a stepping stone and he likes it up there and
    we probably shouldn''t put breakable things high up where they''re likely to fall
    and break and stuff.  Really, it''s our fault.  Not poor Tiko!'

  content: ! 'hmmm..... still with the blaming tiko, hes meant to be a cat and cats
    arent meant to act like bulls in china shops!  i mean benjy is a bit clumsy and
    less cat like too, but at least he makes the effort to not damage things!


    and i feel i have to point out that if its the fault of the person who put the
    delecate things up high, then it cerpently aint worth looking to me!!! i cant
    reach that high!! :oP


    thankyou for the mending though :o) i think eggys chair will have to be mended
    with a bracket or something screwed in underneath to hold the bottom together
    though...'

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;wp-content&#47;WineCollection.jpg"><img src='http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;wp-content&#47;thumb-WineCollection.jpg' alt='Laying down wine for the wedding' class="alignright" &#47;><&#47;a> Last week we took delivery of 108 bottles of wine from Annabel's mum.  It's all wine for the reception after our wedding.  Click on the image to see it in more detail.  You'd never think that people could drink that much!  So far (!) we have:

<ul>
  <li>30 bottles of sparkling wine for the pre-dinner drinks reception.  We reckon that's not enough.<&#47;li>
  <li>24 bottles of Domaine Des Allegrets oak-aged red wine.<&#47;li>
  <li>30 bottles of Domaine Des Allegrets regular red wine.<&#47;li>
  <li>24 bottles of Domaine Des Allegrets white wine.<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

all with our custom labels.  I'm not sure I'm allowed to open the cases and post a picture of the wine bottle with the finished label -- maybe you'll have to wait 'til December 19th to see that -- since I suspect I'd be tempted to 'test' some of the oak aged red.  It is <em>to die for<&#47;em>.  Definitely the most wonderful wine I've ever tasted, at least to my ignorant palette.

Does anybody have any particular tips on laying down wine so that it will survive 'til December?  (Apart from 'a locked cupboard'!)  It's currently sitting in a cupboard in the flat, the only unheated room in the house, since I suspect wine will be happiest with little <em>change<&#47;em> in temperature.  I guess we could put it in the shed at the end of the garden, if that would be better?  Certainly cooler as we get to autumn, but it is a bit stuffy in there just now...
