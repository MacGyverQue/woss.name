Do you ever have one of those days where you've got *so* much to do that it's so daunting and your GTD system is falling apart because there's so much to do that you can't keep it up to date?  That's how I'm feeling today.

And it's obvious -- because I'm picking distractions rather than the important stuff that I *know* I should be doing.  Instead of getting a web site ready to launch (because it's still missing some text and I'm not feeling in a particularly 'literate' mood today), I've rearranged my desk.  And when I say 'rearranged my desk', I mean that in a quite severe way.  See, my workstation used to be perched on the far left side of the desk, with the keyboard and mouse in a pull-out drawer underneath.  (In fact, see the image at the top of [this page](http://woss.name/) to see what I mean, though the computer itself has changed somewhat!)  It's been bugging me -- the laptop perched to my right wasn't particularly usable, I had no decent space for piling up reference books and a notepad within easy reach.  I suspect I'd really set up the desk for a left-handed person.

So I've switched things around.  Now the monitor is almost at the centre of the desk, the keyboard &amp; mouse drawer is on the right hand side, and I'm facing in towards the centre of the desk.  The laptop is on the left, I have a pile of books in front of me and I have space for a notepad on the right.  I no longer have that filing 'thing' arching over the monitor.

So far, it feels much better.  But then again, I haven't actually really started doing any work with it, so who can tell?  Now I'm reinstalling Mac OS X on my laptop (something I've been meaning to do since it changed ownership and function, but not something I *need* to do until the start of next month).

But that doesn't get the task list done, does it?  Or even back into shape!  I've got so many projects and ideas and things that I just need to get out of the road.  And I'm afraid there's lots slipping through the cracks.
