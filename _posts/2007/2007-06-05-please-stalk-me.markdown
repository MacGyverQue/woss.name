I've just created an account on [iStalkr](http://www.istalkr.com/users/mathie) so that you can follow my every move on [my blog](http://woss.name/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mathie), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/mathie_wossname/), [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/mathie/), [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/mathie) and even the [tumblr](http://tumble.woss.name/) I've set up but not yet used.

The timeline idea is pretty neat, so that you have some sort of visualisation of when I've been doing what over the past few days...

That reminds me.  I wonder if one of the old email addresses I used to use when I spent too much time on IRC still works: <mathie@please.stalkme.org>...

(via [Alan](http://blog.alancfrancis.com/2007/06/stalk_me.html))

**Update** Of course, an email has just reminded me that if you want to stalk me *properly* you'll want to use [Google Alerts](http://www.google.com/alerts).  I already have alerts for 'graeme mathieson', 'rubaidh' and 'woss.name' so I know when **you** are talking about **me**. :-)
