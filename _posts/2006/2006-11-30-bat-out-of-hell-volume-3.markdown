OK, I admit it, I'm a closet Meat Loaf fan.  Well, I guess I'm no longer in the closet. :)  I love Jim Steinman's lyrics -- who else could get away with a song entitled *Objects in the rear-view mirror may appear closer than they are*? :)  The operatic sounds, the incredible stories the lyrics tell; just fantastic.

So here I am, having just acquired the new album.  Listening to track and thinking 'WTF?!?'  *The Monster is Loose* is a very different style to his usual fare, isn't it?  Do you somehow suspect he's emulating the likes of Linkin Park (just listen to the guitars!) in order to endear himself to a new generation of listeners?

OK, apart from the silly drum track in the background at the start, *Blind as a Bat* is getting back to his usual style.  Much better. :-)

Of course, now I'm remembering that the real reason I went music-hunting was after hearing a track from Arcade Fire last night and wanting to explore more of their stuff...

**Update** Ooh, a nice update to *Bad for Good* (originally released on Steinman's own album with the same title).  But I'd much rather have heard Meat Loaf's own rendition of *Lost Boys and Golden Girls* if he was going to redo something from that album...
