One of our hosts at work is being attacked by a ned!

[code]sshd:
   Unknown Entries:
      5 more authentication failures; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=ned.gcdtech.com  user=root: 1 Time(s)
      7 more authentication failures; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=ned.gcdtech.com  user=root: 10 Time(s)
   Authentication Failures:
      root (ned.gcdtech.com ): 11 Time(s)[/code]

I'm slightly disappointed to discover that the other machines under the <code>gcdtech.com</code> domain aren't <code>chav</code>, <code>schemie</code> et al.
