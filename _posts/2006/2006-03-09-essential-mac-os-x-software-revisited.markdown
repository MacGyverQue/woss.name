Back in September 2005, I wrote an entry: [Essential Mac OS X software](http://woss.name/2005/09/29/essential-mac-os-x-software/) and I was wondering this morning how things have changed in the past six months.  The hardware has changed quite significantly (but that's the subject of another post!).  What about the software?

Not so much.  I still live in [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com/).  Having now used it for about 9 or 10 months, the shortcuts and snippets are becoming second nature.  Writing [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) code without it would be like losing a limb.  Or possibly two.  Yeah, it would be like coding with my smelly toes!

I've switched back to using [Safari](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/) as my primary browser, but Firefox is always there in the background for browser testing.  As, unfortunately, is IE, sitting in a Virtual PC instance.  One of these days, I should dig out and set up my old Sony VAIO laptop and install Windows on it -- working at the weekend with a borrowed Windows laptop made that kind of testing so much easier.

Likewise, I've switched back to [iChat](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat/) for my main AIM and Jabber account, though I still keep Adium open on my various other IM accounts (MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, another Jabber account).  I just like the way iChat integrates with the rest of my iLife -- I can see in my mail client if John is online, so I can send him a quick IM instead of delaying things having a conversation through email.

The notable new entry is, of course, [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/).  I've been over how wonderful it is in other posts, so I'll just leave it at that.  I still love it, and I'm eagerly awaiting the upgrade to 1.1.

Other than that?  Plus &ccedil;a change.
