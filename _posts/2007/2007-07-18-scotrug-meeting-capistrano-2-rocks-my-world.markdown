At this month's Scottish Ruby User Group meeting, I'll be talking about some of the neat things I've been doing with [Capistrano 2](http://capify.org/) lately and how it totally rocks my world.  Chances are (can you tell I haven't finished writing it yet?!?) we'll cover:

* What's new and exciting in Capistrano 2.
* Creating and bundling your own recipes into plugins.
* Some of the stuff I've already bundled up, including:
  - [Managing Rails apps with the Solaris Service Management Framework](http://woss.name/2007/06/24/integrating-capistrano-with-smf/) refactored to cope with other 'daemon strategies' (as I decided to call them).
  - Staging deployment, complete with release management.  This one is pretty cool, IMHO, the core of which was stolen from Jamis Buck's [Harnessing Capistrano](http://presentations.jamisbuck.org/railsconf2007/) tutorial, but I've tweaked it slightly.
* Using Capistrano for something other than deploying Rails applications.  Chances are it'll have something to do with mail systems.

There will be live demos on live sites (oooh!  aaahhh!), assuming I get Internet access.  Otherwise there'll be mocked up demos on a VMWare instance. :-)

Anyway, [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) have kindly provided us with a venue.  We'll be at the [Edinburgh Training Centre](http://www.edintrain.com/), 16 St Mary's Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1SU ([Google Map](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&q=training+centre&near=Edinburgh&fb=1&cid=0,0,1979863504895226737&z=17&iwloc=A&om=1) though the entrance is on St Mary's Street itself!) this Thursday, 19th July, at 19:30 sharp.  The doors may be locked, so you'll have to buzz the intercom to gain access.

**Update** Well, that's the presentation put together.  Nothing like doing things at the last minute, eh?  Chances are I'm not going to get as far as talking about using Rails for things other than deployment; I'll have to save that for another month and just cover what's shiny about 2.0 this time around.  We'll see how much I ramble on, though.
