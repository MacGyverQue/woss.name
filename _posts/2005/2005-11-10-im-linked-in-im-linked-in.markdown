Yes, I have been watching <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.buffyworld.com&#47;buffy&#47;season1&#47;summaries&#47;08_summ.htm">I Robot, You Jane<&#47;a> recently. :-)

So I've been playing around with <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.linkedin.com&#47;">LinkedIn<&#47;a>, yet another networking tool, this time with more of a business focus.  It's been a popular conversation around the office recently with us currently looking for opportunities to market <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.logicalware.com&#47;">MailManager<&#47;a>, trying to see where one of us might have an 'in' to an organisation.  Mostly it's just interesting to see what (ex-) colleagues are up to these days and who I happen to be only a couple of degrees of separation from professionally.  I suspect it will languish in the same way as my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.orkut.com&#47;">Orkut<&#47;a> account has, but you never know -- it could always be useful.

So, if you're already on <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.linkedin.com&#47;">LinkedIn<&#47;a> (or aren't, but feel like trying it out), do feel free to add me as a connection.  My primary email, as always, is <a href="mailto:mathie@woss.name">mathie@woss.name<&#47;a>.
