We've finally released an alpha preview of MailManager 2.0.1, featuring <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> support.  It's still a little rough around the edges and has some known issues, but it should give the folks who have been clamouring for MySQL support a taste of what's to come.  At this stage, we're looking for lots of feedback, for people to try breaking it, and for lots of informative bug reports.  Patches would be good too. :-)
