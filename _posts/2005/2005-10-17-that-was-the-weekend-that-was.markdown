<em>*phew*</em> That was a productive, yet relaxing weekend.  We have now constructed 80 wedding invites (yes, they're all hand made by us, which is why you may note that they <em>look</em> home made!), figured out the text to put inside them, made up maps of where to find the venues &amp; of local hotels, and scrabbled together the text for an 'extra information' sheet.  We've still to print out the inserts, assemble all the contents into envelopes, figure out who to mail them to and stick them in the post.  I suspect that will be this weekend's task.

Sunday morning was spent wandering around <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/">John Lewis</a>, picking out possible things to put on our wedding list.  We were warned that it might take a few visits.  Then we spent the whole of the 2.5 hours we had to spare in the cookware section!  Not even crockery, or cutlery, or anything like that, just the cookware.  I think this is going to be a long list!  (Not that we <em>expect</em> people to actually buy us presents, really, this is more a "list of stuff we don't have", just in case people <em>do</em> want to buy us a present -- we're trying to figure out a nice way of saying that on the 'extra information' sheet so we don't look like a pair of scroungers!)

The creation of the wedding list at John Lewis is <em>soooo</em> much fun.  You get a bar code scanner and free reign of the store to zap away at anything that takes your fancy.  Well, anything that take <em>our</em> fancy -- I've been told in no uncertain terms that there will be no <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360/default.htm">Xbox 360</a> allowed on the list. :-(  So I've added it to my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1634&tag=mathieoftheen-21&creative=6738&path=registry/5I0QEHXEAPOF">Amazon wishlist</a> instead. :-)

I spent some of the afternoon doing the regular Sainsburys shopping, while Annabel minded the old flat, waiting for people to view (then buy!) the place.  Nobody turned up. :-(  Not even the bloke who had promised to return after seeing the place during my shift on Thursday. :-(  But we then popped along to Zoe's flat to help her with the Order of Service for her wedding in (eek!  scary!) less than two weeks.  And we got to say hello to Star, her 11 month old great niece (at least I think she's the great niece, I was getting confused!) who was so cute with her dinky little fingers, and her tiny wee button nose and all smiley with two front teeth just beginning to show.  Is broodiness an exclusively female thing, or am I allowed to do such things too? :-)
