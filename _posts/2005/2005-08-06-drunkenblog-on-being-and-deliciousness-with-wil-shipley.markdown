I've spent the past while reading through an extremely long interview on [DrunkenBlog](http://www.drunkenblog.com/): [On Being and Deliciousness, with Wil Shipley](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000581.html).  Mostly I was looking for some insight into when [Delicious Library](http://www.delicious-monster.com/) 2.0 would be released (and it sounds like that's not too far off), but I wound up finding it an enthralling read about a bloke that's been working with Cocoa, like, forever.

This, of course, was a distraction from what I'd intended to do, which was update my library with all the bits and bobs that have appeared since we moved flat.
