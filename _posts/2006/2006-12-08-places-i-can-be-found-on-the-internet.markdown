There are a few public Internet-based tools I use on a regular basis and I figured, since I can't think of anything exciting to say this morning, I should list them here:

* [Notes From a Messy Desk](http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;) -- here, obviously. :-)
* [Rubaidh Ltd](http:&#47;&#47;www.rubaidh.com&#47;) my company's web site.
* I am [mathie](http:&#47;&#47;del.icio.us&#47;mathie) on del.icio.us, which I have once again started using a little more for keeping track of interesting stuff I read.
* I am also [mathie](http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;mathie&#47;) on Flickr, which I sporadically upload photographs to.
* My strange [taste in music](http:&#47;&#47;www.last.fm&#47;user&#47;mathie_wossname&#47;) can be discerned at Last.fm.
* I [twitter about where I am](http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;mathie) sometimes.

I think that's about it.  At least that's all the places I've visited or updated in the past 24 hours. :-)  Feel free to befriend me or add me as a contact or whatever on any of these sites.
