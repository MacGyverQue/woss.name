> #### Caught Spam
>
> Akismet has caught 14,504 spam for you since you installed it.

That'll have been since 16th January this year when I upgraded to WordPress 2.0, I think.  I'm impressed.  That'll be about 50 spam comments every day that it's caught.  Thank you, [akismet](http://akismet.com/)!

**Update**: And less than 2 days later, it's up to 15,130 caught spam.  So I'm currently being barraged with about 360 comment spams a day (~15 per hour)!
