I've just recently launched another small web site for a local Edinburgh
artist, [John V Gardner](http://www.johnvgardner.com/). This joins the
existing site I created about 6 months ago for [Deborah A
Cameron](http://www.deborahcameron.com/). I wrote the code far too long ago,
and it's a little bit ropey, but it appears to work (it's the same application
serving both those domains, using the aforementioned `account_location` for
inspiration, plus some extra jiggery-pokery) and the two artists in question
are happy with it.

Now that I've launched the second site, I am having the temptation to revisit the code, robustify it and actually try to market the site a little.  The UI needs reworked (it was done bespoke for Debbie and is exactly what she was looking for, though it doesn't scale particularly well), and the site could do with being a little more flexible, but the idea is good (and simple!) enough.

So go have a browse, buy some paintings (online purchase will be available in the new year sometime, so just email John & Debbie in the meantime!) and support new local talent.  Come to think of it, if you buy some of their paintings, maybe they'll support me, too. :)

And if you know an artist who's looking for a simple to use web presence, I'm still looking for beta testers to help shape the product...
