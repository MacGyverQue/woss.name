After having been wittering on about getting a faster CF card for my camera, I went searching for some performance statistics.  The [article at dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com/articles/mediacompare/) is seriously out of date, with the last entry having been added in October 2001.  It rates the fastest RAW write performance in a Canon EOS-1D (top of the line wotsit!) to be in the region of 2.6MB/s in real world tests.  Eek!  I hope things have improved since then!

It turns out they have.  Rob Galbraith has a table of relative [write performance for the Canon EOS 350D](http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=6007-7699) (ie my camera).  It turns out that the fastest performing card is the SanDisk Extreme III, at nearly 6.3MB/s in real world tests with RAW images.  However, that's just less than the average size of one image when I'm shooting RAW.  So there's still only ever a hope of achieving ~1fps continuously in RAW mode.  (However, the camera does have enough buffer space for approximately 5 shots, so shooting in drive mode at 3fps, I can run off about 7 shots before it slows down.)

But that's not the particularly interesting bit.  My existing faster card, the Ultra II 512MB performs at approximately 5.7MB/s, which is not too far behind.  So I'd not be getting any major improvement by going for the Extreme III, unless the prices were fairly similar.  In fact, it looks like the best bet might be the SanDisk Ultra II 2GB cards, so long as I'm sure I'll be getting the post January 2005 stock (which switched the underlying technology slightly) -- they perform at just a shade over 6MB/s RAW.

Another factor to note is that performance does appear to degrade if the capacity goes above 2GB.  This is because the cards are formatted with the MS-DOS FAT filesystem.  There are two different 'versions' of it: FAT16 and FAT32.  The former has a limit of 2GB for a single filesystem, which is why larger cards have to use FAT32.  However, FAT16 does appear to perform slightly better.  So, for performance, maybe it's better to stick to 2GB cards.

Now let's look at prices.  Since I'm lazy and I have an associates ID, let's look at Amazon prices. :)  The [SanDisk 2GB Ultra II](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007QU6WY/mathieoftheen-21) is currently Â£124.99, whereas the [SanDisk 2GB Extreme III](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007QU70U/mathieoftheen-21) is Â£152.99.  Is is worth an extra Â£28 to get a 3.4% increase in speed?

Why is this important?  I always shoot in drive mode, which means I get a selection of pictures to choose from when I get back to the laptop -- I can choose the best between subtle variations in pose or facial expression.  Or I can start shooting just before that bus moves out the frame, just in case the next one moves into the frame before I press the button -- chances are I'll get at least one picture that's bus-free.  Or the snap of the shutter will attract Tiko's attention so he's actually looking at the camera by the second or third shot.
