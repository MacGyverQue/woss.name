So, what do you pack in terms of photography gear when you're going on holiday?  We're travelling by car, so there are no real restrictions on what I can carry.  (Not that it's ever stopped me before!)  So, what's coming with me?

* [Canon EOS 350D camera body](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_350d/index.asp)
* Lenses:
  - [Canon 50mm f/1.8 Mk II](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Fixed_Focal_Length/EF_50mm_f18II/index.asp)
  - [Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/ef_lenses/zoom_lenses/ef-s_18-55mm_f-3.5-5.6/index.asp)
  - [Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/ef_lenses/zoom_lenses/ef_75300mm_f456iii_usm/index.asp)
  - [Sigma 105mm f/2.8 EX DG](http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3253&navigator=5)
  - [Sigma 170-500mm f/5-6.3 DG](http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3276&navigator=3)
* [Speedlite 420EX](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=141&modelid=7394) flash
* UV filters for all the lenses (mostly as protection to prevent the front of the lens from being scratched, but Coll does get the highest levels of sunshine in the UK, so they'll have a practical benefit too).
* Circular polarising filter and [Cokin filter system](http://www.cokin.co.uk/pages/cokinP.htm) (with an ND grad. filter) for the 58mm diameter lenses (ie ell but the 50mm prime and the 170-500mm).
* 2x512MB and 1x2GB flash cards.
* [Manfrotto 190CLB](http://www.manfrotto.com/Jahia/cache/offonce/pid/2216?livid=68|69&idx=71) tripod with a [141 head](http://www.manfrotto.com/Jahia/cache/offonce/pid/2336?livid=80|81&idx=82).  And a mini-tripod from tkerby. :)
* Spare batteries and charger, including for the flash.
* [Mini-maglite](http://www.maglite.com/product.asp?psc=2AACELL&pt=R) [sodding-big-maglite](http://www.maglite.com/product.asp?psc=3DCELL) and [Leatherman Wave](http://www.leatherman.co.uk/home/wave/index.htm).
* Elastic bands and plastic bags to protect the camera from the elements.  Elastic bands and tissues are also useful to me as a cheap (and amusing) flash diffuser.
* Cables for connecting to the laptop, along with my PowerBook and Aperture, to download photos at the end of the day.
* Camera cleaning kit.

I've also got the apropos gear for coping with the elements:

* Hiking boots and gaiters.
* Shiny new trousers from Tiso that claim to do everything in the world ever, including blocking UV rays equivalent to SPF 50.  (I'd never noticed clothing advertising like sun block before!)
* A cool hat. :)
* Decent jacket and fleece, and a cagoule.

I think now all I need is the pack horse to carry it all.  Annabel? :)
