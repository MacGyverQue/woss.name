I gather that Annabel and her mum are off to Barcelona at the last weekend of November for a 'hen weekend'...  So if anybody was happening to want to organise something something similar, that weekend would be particularly apropos, and maybe you want to direct suggestions to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.drossy.net&#47;blog&#47; rel="friend">Derek<&#47;a>. :-)
