  content: Yeah, that's the resource I was gelaming my 'knowledge' from.  I didn't
    want to take too much time to grok it since I'm in work and supposed to be, well,
    working!

On the plus side of last night's excursion, I did discover -- from being hooked up to this fancy machine -- that my general health is pretty good.  After the panic subsided, I realised I was OK, and started to relax, my blood pressure stabilised at 134/81.  Much better than it has been in the past!  And my resting heart rate was about 59.  OK, so that's not quite as impressive as it used to be (when I was doing a <em>lot</em> of cycling, my resting heart rate was generally in the early 50s!), but I suspect it's still pretty good for a 26 year old.  The SpO<sub>2</sub> reading was about 99% -- I'm guessing that has something to do with oxygen saturation levels, but I'm not entirely clear and Google is just throwing up results to do with people selling SpO<sub>2</sub> monitors...
