I realise that it's nearly two months since I last updated my reading list.  Oops.  I suppose I haven't exactly been consuming books at any rate recently anyway.  OK, so what have I read since I last posted...?

<ul>
  <li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0006551270&#47;mathieoftheen-21">Girlfriend in a Coma<&#47;a> by Douglas Coupland (23mm)<&#47;li>
  <li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;097669400X&#47;mathieoftheen-21">Agile Web Development with Rails<&#47;a> by Dave Thomas (28mm)<&#47;li>
  <li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0755305078&#47;mathieoftheen-21">Anansi Boys<&#47;a> by Neil Gaiman (35mm)<&#47;li>
  <li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0752865633&#47;mathieoftheen-21">Fleshmarket Close<&#47;a> by Ian Rankin (33mm)<&#47;li>
  <li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0349112096&#47;mathieoftheen-21">One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night<&#47;a> by Christopher Brookmyre (27mm)<&#47;li>
  <li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0755322800&#47;mathieoftheen-21">Neverwhere<&#47;a> by Neil Gaiman (26mm)<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

That's another 172mm to add to the pile for the year, totalling 1129mm.  So the total height of books I've read so far this year, piled on top of each other, reaches just over 1.1 metres high.  Particularly given all the things that need to be done over the next few weeks (four weeks, 6 days!) I somehow doubt that I'll complete the challenge of reading my own height in books over the course of this year.  Not unless I chop off my legs at the knee.  Hmm.  That could work. :-)  As it is, this is our last night in, without anything in particular planned, for at least the next week, probably longer.  So I'm spending it reading <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0575073659&#47;mathieoftheen-21">Chasm City<&#47;a> by Alastair Reynolds, whilst curled up in bed.  Just the way to unwind after a peculiarly crappy day at work...
