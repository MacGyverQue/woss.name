  <dt>Annabel<&#47;dt><dd>nope, all references to 'the cats' refer to the two evil little destroyers also known as tiko and saffy.. <strong>my<&#47;strong> cats are loveable little balls of fluffy cuteness that have never destroyed precious things of mine!!!<&#47;dd>

See, poor Tiko had a wee accident sometime last night.  He managed to knock a couple of things off the top of the bookshelf and break them.  Really it was our fault -- we shouldn't have breakable things at that kind of height (OK, that'd be <em>my<&#47;em> fault then!), and we'd left boxes in front of the bookshelf to facilitate his climb and, after all, the top of that bookshelf was one of his favourite spots when he was living with my parents.  But he's been told that he's on his last warning.  Any more breakages and the pair of them are being put in a box addressed to my parents in Hamilton and stuck by the post box!  (And I don't <em>really<&#47;em> think Jessica would do anything nasty, but she's one of <em>Annabel's<&#47;em> and seemed like a good scapecat at the time!)
