I've just spent the afternoon doing an odd mashup between the <a href="http://www.logicalware.com/">MailManager</a> user interface and the public web site of a potential customer that Andy is visiting tomorrow.  All done in Photoshop, since I'd need to have tweaked some background images anyway, and it was easier just to do that lot in one.  It probably wouldn't be appreciated if I posted the results, but suffice to say I think they look really good.  My l33t Ph0t0sh0p sk1llz are coming along nicely. :-)

In random other news, last night I created a <a href="http://woss.name/status/">status</a> page, which reflects my current, personal, status.  And it should show you if I've been listening to any music recently.  This is blatently a straight rip-off of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/status/">Merlin's Status Page</a>, using exactly the same tools, but it seems like a neat idea to me.

Do you have any suggestions as to what other 'status' information I should be displaying there?
