I rediscovered [Apocalyptica](http://www.apocalyptica.com/home/) again this morning, while shopping for some new music online.  I seem to recall [broonie](http://www.sirena.org.uk/log/) loaning me one of their albums a few years back, but I'd completely forgotten they existed.  They are probably best known for [Metallica by Four Cellos](http://www.apocalyptica.com/releases/metallica.php).  It just so happens that I think the cello is the most beautiful sounding instrument in the world ever, so I'm having a fun morning listening to [Amplified](http://www.apocalyptica.com/releases/amplified.php), their new best-of (currently listening to a really neat version of Hall of the Mountain King).

In other news, Tim Kerby has kindly loaned me a [Gossen](http://www.gossen-photo.de/english/) Spot-Master light meter.  I've had a quick test of it this morning and I think I've figured out how it works, though it does seem to wind up +2/3 Ev compared to my camera's TTL meter (measured against filling the frames with an 18% grey card in direct sunlight).  I wonder if that's something I ought to bear in mind when transferring readings from the light meter to the camera (and if so, why the difference?), or whether I'm doing something wrong...

Anyway, less of these distractions.  Back to work for me!
