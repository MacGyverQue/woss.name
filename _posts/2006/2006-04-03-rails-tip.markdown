  content: <p>IIRC, you can append to existing methods in capistrano recipes by defining
    a method called 'after_[methodname]'.  For example, @after_update_code@ and @after_setup@
    should work...</p>

I've just submitted by first tip to [Rails Weenie](http://rails.techno-weenie.net/): [integrating file_column and capistrano](http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2006/4/3/integrating_file_column_and_capistrano).  Well, it works for me.  I should really DRY it up a litle, taking the file_column path from environment.rb in deploy.rb, and I'm not entirely enthused about replacing `update_code` and `setup`, but I couldn't see a way to append stuff to an existing task.

I just discovered it was a general enough tip by copying it from one project to another and having it Just Work!  I'm currently working on refactoring something I wrote a while ago, using all the l33t Rails knowledge I've learned in the interim.
