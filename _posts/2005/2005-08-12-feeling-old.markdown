I gather that today is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.un.org&#47;esa&#47;socdev&#47;unyin&#47;iyouthday.htm" title="Youth at the United Nations: 12 August - International Youth Day">International Youth Day<&#47;a>.  But that's not the scary part.  According to the UN definition:

<blockquote>
<p>... the world youth population -- defined by the United Nations as the age cohort 15-24 -- ...<&#47;p>
<cite><a href="http:&#47;&#47;daccess-ods.un.org&#47;TMP&#47;2720543.html">50&#47;81. World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond <&#47;a>, section 2, paragraph 9<&#47;cite>
<&#47;blockquote>

I'm no longer a youth!  And haven't been for quite some time.  What's next?  Middle age?  It's feeling that way this morning...
