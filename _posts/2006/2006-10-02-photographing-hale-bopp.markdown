I just stumbled across an old article on [Strobist](http:&#47;&#47;strobist.blogspot.com&#47;) (for some reason, I have old news feeds on my laptop that NNW didn't sync to my desktop -- strange) about how to light a comet.  It tells the story of [John Moran](http:&#47;&#47;www.johnmoranphoto.com&#47;) building a contraption to counteract the Earth's rotation, lighting the foreground, and capturing an *incredible* picture of Hale-Bopp.  I'm totally in awe.

The full article is here: [On Assignment: How To Light a Comet](http:&#47;&#47;strobist.blogspot.com&#47;2006&#47;09&#47;on-assignment-how-to-light-comet.html).  Even if you're not interested in the details of how it was done, I'd encourage you to at least scroll to the bottom of the article and check out the resulting image.  Incredible, just incredible.  I think I need a print of that on my wall, just to remind me what's possible with a bit of effort.
