After a little prodding (OK, more than a little -- my dad's been nagging me for weeks!), I've gotten around to updating my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1634&amp;tag=mathieoftheen-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;path=registry/5I0QEHXEAPOF">Amazon wish list</a>, and I'll endeavour to stop letting it get out of date.  That's the trouble with buying stuff from places that <em>aren't</em> Amazon!  Part of the list is keeping track of the Ian Rankin books I'm still missing, but mostly I just keep an eye on second hand bookshops for these.  I should probably add the wishlist to the side bar on this blog, just on the off-chance that some nice person feels extremely generous and decides to give me something to do so I don't spend all my time blogging and bugging y'all. :-)
