I haven't bought a real, live, proper CD in *ages*.  But patience is not a virtue of mine, so when I discovered that [Placebo](http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/) have a new album out -- [Meds](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000E5L8BG/mathieoftheen-21) -- I had to rush out on Saturday and buy it.  And, as my [last.fm profile](http://www.last.fm/user/mathie_wossname) should attest (though I've probably just skewed it by looking for the intro of another track!), I've been listening to it constantly since.  Definitely up to their usual, wonderful, standard.  The combination of stunning, cynical, entendre-laden lyrics with a mixture of musical styles reminds me why they are one of my top bands of all time.
