(A proper review of Lightroom will appear shortly!)<br &#47;>

I don't rate myself at all at taking portraits, but Olivia and Daniel are just so photogenic that I reckon it'd be impossible to take a bad picture of them.  I'm really pleased with these results.  Take a look through the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;mathie&#47;sets&#47;72157600032359381&#47;">entire photoset<&#47;a> and tell me what you think!
