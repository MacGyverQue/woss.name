<p>So we didn't get around to writing diaries yesterday 'cos Annabel didn't feel like it.  I suspect that really she will suffering from the previous night.  Which is where I left of, so...</p>

      <p>The octopus, squid &amp; cuttlefish were lovely.  With a direct comparison, I've decided that squid was the best.  Cuttlefish is a new experience -- I thought it was something that budgies sharpened their beaks on! -- but it has flesh too, and very tasty it is.  We were supposed to just have starters there, then move on elsewhere for main course, but the seafood was so substantial that we then retired to a bar on the shorefront.</p>

      <p>We were very good, drinking large bottles of water with each bottle of Retsina.  Then I switched from wine to beer -- note to self: you don't like Heineken, though clearly your taste buds were beyond caring by that point; they replayed the taste for you the next day, though, eh? -- and John to Raki since we were curious as to what it was.  Turns out it was basically eau de vie (aka fire water) type stuff.  But John seemed to like it.</p>

      <p>The evening passed out about 02:00 when we headed back to the apartment to collapse.  I woke up around 11am -- John could be heard pottling around out on the balcony shortly afterwards.  Annabel was un-rousable until well after 14:00!  John and I spent the intervening time reading books.</p>

      <p>Getting up was a slow process, but by about 16:00 we'd dragged ourselves out in the hire car and went starred agama hunting.  I quickly developed my camera technique &amp; managed to get close enough for a few full-frame shots of the aforementioned lizards.  It was all done with my telephoto lens maxed out on 300mm.  I started taking shots from the tripod, but it was a bit too low and took a long time to set up just right.  After that I opted to shoot from the hip, using the tripod to brace the camera against my body for some stability.  Moving very quietly, I creeped closer to the static beastie, stopping to take shots every so often.  That way I'd always have <em>something </em> but would strive to improve on it before I got close enough to scare him away.  Ooh, look, I'm learning field craft!  Next I'll be hiding in camouflaged hides, sitting for hours waiting for that prized pigeons photograph!</p>

      <p>I seem to be wandering off on a tangent, so where was I?  Ah, yes.  We headed out further along the road through the centre of the island, enjoying the scenery.  At the end of the road, we turned left (North) and stopped at a tiny church with an abandoned car and some nice cows -- I have photographs of them all!</p>

      <p>I'm told I'm being slow -- Annabel's writing a diary too, and she's already on to the tail end of this afternoon, more than 24 hours beyond me!  Maybe I write slowly...  Or maybe I'm just too verbose...  I should note now, left I forget by tomorrow, that we're currently sitting in a bar by the shore supping nice cocktails.  I've had a really good Bloody Mary, and am currently working my way through a Strawberry Daiquiri.  Which is all healthy, really, as it's fresh strawberries pureed with crushed ice.  And rum. :-)</p>

      <p>Anyway, we'll maybe come back to these distractions later.  After taking lots of photos of the cross atop the church &amp; the car &amp; the cows &amp; nearby settlements on the horizon, we headed off again.  Next stop was and 8th Century BCE burial ground.  It turned out that the trek to it was more than we felt like, but I did get photographs of ants, chickens and a cow's bottom.  Thus was the capacity of my 2GB flash card.</p>

      <p>We headed back to the apartment, having some quiet time with our books.  I just felt like having something to eat close by, so we headed to Poseidon, the place next up from Oasis.  We had a lovely meal, starting with Skordalia, tatziki, stuffed vine leaves &amp; some complementary ouzo.  Mains was individual things -- John had sea bream in a tomato sauce, Annabel had moussaka and I had Rabbit Politiko, which was wonderful!  And it's the first time I've eaten rabbit without a chorus of <q>Bright Eyes</q> in the background.  The rest of the evening was spent chatting with the owner's wife,  an ex-pat from Swindon, who had some great advice about what to see, where to go and, more importantly, where <em>not</em> to go!  I should have probably written some of it done, but I didn't at the time, and it seems to have slipped my mind now.</p>
