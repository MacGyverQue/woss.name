<p>If you're reading this, I think I've successfully moved my Wordpress blog across to <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>&nbsp;after it was recommended by a few folks on Twitter. &nbsp;If you're not reading this, please let me know. :-) I'll switch the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/wossname">RSS feed</a> across shortly, too, so apologies if you see a bunch of (really old) repeated articles in your feed reader.</p>
<p>If Squarespace doesn't work out, there's no harm, I'll be back to Wordpress again without any loss. But it's worth a try. The main lossage right now seems to be that I'll want to recode all the code examples that are kicking around and, unless I want to manually syntax highlight with HTML, I'll have to find an external service to do it. GitHub's <a href="http://gist.github.com/">gists</a> are probably the way forward if I need an external service, right?</p>
<p>Meantime, if you could all kick the tyres, leave some comments and let me know the new place is working out OK for you, that would be awesome. :-)</p>
