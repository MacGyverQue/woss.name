It's been a while since I've blogged. That seems to be about 25% of what I say
here. I seem to have spent more time patching
[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) to cover security vulnerabilities than I
have actually writing content in the past year.

So it's time for a change. I've switched to a static site generator called
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I've hacked together a very plain visual
style (with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) because it's about
the only way I can pretend to do CSS).

And I've been writing again. I've got a backlog of material sitting in
[EverNote](http://www.evernote.com) which can be tidied up and turned into
potentially useful blog posts. Let's set a schedule and see what we can do.

So check back here next Wednesday, and every Wednesday after that, see if I've
kept my promise to myself...
