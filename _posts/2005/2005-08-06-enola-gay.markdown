  content: <p>I recall probably forty or more years ago hearing that the name Enola
    Gay stood for "Young American GIs Alone".  It was only this morning while watching
    a DVD of the TV series "The World at War" produced in the mid seventies that I
    learned the pilot had named the plane after his mother.<&#47;p>

  content: ! '<p>Thank you for settling this for me.  I''ve pondered this for years.  Never
    before had I heard that BG Tibbets named the plane for his mother.  It''s just
    too uncanny that the anagram reads:  Young American GI''s Alone, yet it''s not
    the reason for the name.  I was surprised that you made no mention of&#47;reference
    to the eerily descriptive anagram.<&#47;p>


    <p>That said, thank you again.  It was fun finding this online and reading the
    interesting story of General Tibbets and the Enola Gay.<&#47;p>


    <p>Best,

    Linda DiNardo<&#47;p>'

  content: ! '<p>It''s possible that Tibbets was chosen  his mother''s name was Enola
    Gay.  From what I''ve heard, he was a last minute substi-tute for the man who
    was originally to have flown the mission, much to the latter''s displeasure.<&#47;p>


    <p>Though I''m not a geneologist, I did manage to confirm through research that
    Enola Gay was his mother''s name.  Nothing this important ever happens by chance.<&#47;p>'

Today's episode of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bbc.co.uk&#47;radio4&#47;excessbaggage&#47;" title="Excess Baggage on BBC Radio 4">Excess Baggage<&#47;a> is (predictably) about Hiroshima.  I've been meaning, every time I've heard it recently to find out the significance of the name of the aeroplane that dropped 'Little Boy' on Hiroshima: <em>Enola Gay<&#47;em>.  I'd assumed there was some significance about Enola being 'alone' spelled backwards, but I couldn't see where Gay ('yag'?) fitted in.  Wikipedia to the rescue -- from its entry on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Enola_Gay" title="Enola Gay - Wikipedia">Enola Gay<&#47;a>:

<blockquote><p>Colonel Paul Tibbets, the plane's pilot, named her <em>[the plane]<&#47;em> after his mother Enola Gay Tibbets (1893&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;1983, who in turn had been named after the heroine of a novel).<&#47;p><&#47;blockquote>

I haven't managed to find out anything more about the novel, other than it being one her father liked...

On the other hand, I have discovered, through Google, that there are several sites that are basically reskins of Wikipedia, reprinting exactly the same text, links an' all.  I suppose that's one of the 'advantages' of releasing stuff under a free license, but really, what's the point of cargo-culting stuff from elsewhere, rather than linking to it, particularly when somebody who isn't paying close attention might assume it to be your own work?
