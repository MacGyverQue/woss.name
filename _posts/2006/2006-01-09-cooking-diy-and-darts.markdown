Sunday was one of those relaxing, yet productive days.  After spending the first part of the morning lying in bed, drinking coffee, catching up on back-issues of Practical Photography, listening to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/bh/">Broadcasting House</a>, we got up and tidied the house a little in preparation for my parents visiting for Sunday Lunch.  Things like clearing the study of all the carboard boxes that wedding gifts had arrived in.  Putting up the mirror in the living room that's been lying against a wall for over 6 months now, waiting to be placed above the fire.  Putting pictures up on walls.  Cleaning some of the kerfuffle that has developed recently.

That took more than the morning, which meant we were a little behind schedule.  However, Annabel got on with pudding (<a href="http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/fallen-chocolate-souffle-with-armagnac-prunes,1195,RC.html">Fallen Chocolate Souffle with Port Prunes</a>) for the Sunday lunch while I cleaned the bathroom.  The wonderful aromas of cooking were already permeating the flat.  Starter was a pea and ham soup that I'd made a while ago and stored in the freezer, so that was a case of looking it out and allowing it to defrost.  Main course was a joint of Silverside beef, roasted with garlic &amp; thyme, carrots cooked with fennel, brussel sprouts and garlic-roast potatoes.  The carrots in particular were a success, and I think I got the beef just about right.

Dinner was rounded off with some cheese and biscuits over coffee before my parents returned home.  It's the first time we've properly 'hosted' dinner for anybody else, and I think it was a success. :-)  It also gave us the opportunity to use the posh cutlery, tablecloth, napkins and placemats.  And the food warmer to keep the vegetables warm at the table.  Of course, it was yet another chance for me to use the fantastic new Sabatier knives we have which make chopping <em>anything</em> feel like a hot knife through butter!

After my parents disappeared back homeward, we decided to put up another of the wedding presents: a dartboard.  It's now erected behind the sofa on one of the walls of the living room.  Coincidentally, the edge of the fireplace exactly marks the hockey line.  So we spent the remainder of the evening drinking lovely whisky (Ardbeg and Glen Marnoch), eating kettle chips, listening to <a href="http://www.classicfm.com/">Classic FM</a> and playing darts.  Where else could you possibly find that combination of entertainment?
