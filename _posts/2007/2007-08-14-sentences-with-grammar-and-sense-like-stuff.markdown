  content: ! '<p>Haha, that really is some poor quality grammar. Looks like someone
    found some big words in a dictionary, but didn''t know how to put them together
    properly :-)</p>


    <p>I do agree that not enough emphasis and effort is put into documentation. Which
    is a great shame.</p>'

  content: ! '<p>It''s not just documentation I''m talking about, though I do agree
    that documentation should be seen as a core component of a development iteration,
    rather than the afterthought it generally is.</p>


    <p>What I mean, though, is that <em>every</em> official communication from an
    organisation should not only be checked for accuracy, but should be copy-edited
    so that it meets the uniform style guidelines of the organisation.  In my head,
    I''m not sure if that should extend to every email or fax, but it certainly should
    cover all web pages, blog posts &amp; printed material.</p>


    <p>I am probably in a tiny minority here, but I''m afraid I do judge people and
    companies for poor grammar.  I''m not saying I won''t subscribe to your amazing
    service because your application framework''s <code>to_sentence</code> implementation
    defaults to spitting out an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma"
    rel="nofollow">Oxford Comma</a> (fixed in my apps with a plugin!) but it does
    get you a black mark! :-)</p>


    <p>Seriously, though, one of the criteria I use to judge CVs, for example, is
    use of the English language.  It tells me something about the candidate''s attention
    to detail and how much they care about being able to communicate effectively.  Misuse
    of the apostrophe gets your CV binned immediately.</p>'

As I [ranted on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mathie/statuses/205173902) earlier this morning, I was reading a document from a rather large, well-established payment service provider talking about a massive, monolithic, upgrade they were about to undertake.  The documentation I was reading was about the potential impact on applications which use their service.  I'll quote a portion for you:

> The remote administration features continues however because the underlying architecture has changed the responses our system returns now be as follows.

It doesn't make any more sense in context, but revealing the context may reveal the offender. :-)  I'm interpreting it as:

> The remote administration features will continue to be supported as-is, however because the underlying architecture has changed, the responses our system return have been modified as follows:

Now I'm not particularly criticising the person who wrote the document; obviously their skills are specialised towards the technical end of the spectrum and that's perfectly reasonable.  Mine are too.  However, what's not acceptable is that a company let this out their door as being representative of the company.  Now I happen to know this particular company also produces several print publications and has a staff of editors.  In my humble opinion, *every* document that comes out of an organisation should be proofed for style, particularly if that organisation has the professional capability in-house!

OK, rant over.  I'll now allow you to pull apart this post, pointing out all the grammatical errors, in the comments. :-)
