Finally, [MailManager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mailmanager/) 2.0 has <del>escaped</del> been released!  Download [MailManager-2.0.tar.gz](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mailmanager/MailManager-2.0.tar.gz?download) and [3rdParty-2.0.tar.gz](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mailmanager/3rdParty-2.0.tar.gz?download), find yourself an installation of [Zope](http://www.zope.org/) and go play!  Or, for those poor, unfortunately souls, we've also got a [win32 installer](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mailmanager/mailmanager-2.0.exe?download) which includes Python &amp; Zope already.

I think that deserves a celebration...
