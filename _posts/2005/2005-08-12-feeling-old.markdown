I gather that today is [International Youth Day](http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin/iyouthday.htm).  But that's not the scary part.  According to the UN definition:

<blockquote>
<p>... the world youth population -- defined by the United Nations as the age cohort 15-24 -- ...</p>
<cite>[50/81. World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond ](http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/2720543.html), section 2, paragraph 9</cite>
</blockquote>

I'm no longer a youth!  And haven't been for quite some time.  What's next?  Middle age?  It's feeling that way this morning...
