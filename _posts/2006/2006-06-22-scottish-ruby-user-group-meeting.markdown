Just a wee reminder that the second Scottish Ruby User Group meeting is
tonight at The Regent, Montrose Terrace, Edinburgh. You can find out the full
details in the [entry about the first
meeting](http://woss.name/2006/05/11/scottish-ruby-user-group/). Chances are
I'll be there shortly after 7pm.

There's no particular format to the meeting, though it would be good this time to have a chat about making it a regular event, and what we would like to get out of the group.

See y'all tonight! :-)
