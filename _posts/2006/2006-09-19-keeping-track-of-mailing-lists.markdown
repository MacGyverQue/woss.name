OK, so one of the things I got out of the Rails Conference (and in particular was mentioned in DHH's `Keynote::Rant`) is that I'd like to get more actively involved in the Rails community.  Of course, I read lots of blogs already and have a place in my workflow for that, but something I've been missing for a while is how to keep up with and interact with mailing lists.

Currently, I can't have them go straight into my inbox.  That way would just lie madness.  So I filtering them off into their own folder.  There are two problems there:  the folder is local (and I use two computers for mail on a regular basis) so it gets fragmented; and if I'm busy I wind up ignoring it until there are 1,500 messages in there and the only way to deal with that volume (to me) is `option-a, delete`.

I could go back to various other solutions involving server-side filtering (which relies on a good IMAP implementation both sides to be notified of updates to non-INBOX folders, and to do offline synchronisation) and pushing each mailing list into its own mailbox, but that's kind of missing the point.  I actually want to deal with email which is addressed to **me** in my mail application, not general list traffic.  It's a context thing.  So I want to find another application I'm comfortable with for dealing with mailing list traffic.

Unfortunately, so far I've found nothing which fits the bill.  I guess there's no easy way of having a second instance of Mail.app with a different set of accounts (it's easy enough to arrange another account for mailing list mail).  So it's a case of looking at other applications, which boils down to three options:

* Another mail client.
* A usenet news client, using gmane.
* An RSS client, again using gmane.

I have been concentrating my efforts on finding a usenet client for Mac OS X.  There doesn't appear to be one which doesn't suck.  The foremost usenet client for Mac OS X seems to be [Unison](http://www.panic.com/unison/) and I've tried it out a few times.  I tried to like it, honestly.  But it feels more like it's designed for l33t war3z kiddies than for actually carrying on a conversation.  It's MIME decoding skills aren't great, particularly with respect to character sets.

I could go back to [XEmacs](http://xemacs.org/) with [Gnus](http://gnus.org/) which I used for *many* years.  In fact, back then, whichever operating system I happened to be using (Linux, Solaris), just happened to be a host OS for my XEmacs -- I lived in there.  But I've been spoiled by pretty widgets from Cocoa, and the limited interaction would make life slightly less pleasant.  Also, I've finally mapped my fingers to the Mac shortcuts which makes my life faster in a text editor.  I wouldn't want to confuse the poor digits again.

So.  How do you read mailing lists?  How do you efficiently take part in mailing lists while still Getting Things Done?
