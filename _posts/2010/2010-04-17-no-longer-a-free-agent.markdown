<p>If you've been <a href="http://twitter.com/mathie">following me on Twitter</a>, you may have heard that my career has taken a slightly different direction in the past few weeks. I've been running <a href="http://www.rubaidh.com/">Rubaidh</a> for over 4 years now and for the most part it's been a hugely enjoyable experience. I've learned a number of new skills both in technology and, most of all, in terms of what's needed to run a successful business. I've also had the opportunity to work with a lot of really awesome people and on a number of great projects.</p>
<p>However, last year was pretty tough. I know it was tough for everyone, what with the media exacerbating a blip in the economy, but there were a couple of particular incidents (that I won't go into because it wouldn't be professional to do so) which made me decide if that's how people do business, I really don't want to do business.</p>
<p>Also, in general, I was spending more time stressing about money, pitching for new work and dealing with paperwork than I was doing the two things I love best:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing great software; and</li>
<li>spending quality time with my family.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter, in particular, was suffering, and it wasn't fair on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/4430997275/">Annabel &amp; Malcolm</a>. So at the start of this year, I quietly started looking for a new job.</p>
<p>And I've really landed on my feet. On Thursday, I started working at <a href="http://www.freeagentcentral.com/?referrer=1250vxcy">FreeAgent Central</a>, who have created an awesome online accounting system for small businesses and freelancers. I've been a happy customer of FreeAgent for a couple of years now, and I already know that there's an awesome team of people behind the project, so I'm really excited to be working there.</p>
<p>As for <a href="http://rubaidh.com/">Rubaidh</a>, it's not going to disappear. I've still got a number of happy customers who can continue to rely on me to support them. I'll also still be taking on the odd small project here and there, mostly as an excuse to play around with new technologies, which is sometimes more difficult in a large established application (I reckon it'll be a wee while before FreeAgent bumps up to Rails 3, for example!).</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll also have more spare time to contribute back to the open source community again, and to start keeping this blog a bit more up to date... That would be nice.</p>
<p>So. Here's to new opportunities. 2010 is looking like it's going to be an awesome year. :-)</p>
<p>(Oh, and if you <a href="http://www.freeagentcentral.com/?referrer=1250vxcy">sign up to FreeAgent Central</a> with my referrer, we both get 10% off our accounts for life. What could be better than that?)</p>
