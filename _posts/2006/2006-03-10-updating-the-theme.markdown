I'm partway through updating the theme on this site to the latest beta of [K2](http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/k2).  I think it's looking much prettier so far, but there's still some customisation to be reintegrated (like all revenue-generating Google ads, and the picture of a messy desk, which really ought to be updated anyway!).  What do you think?  Does it look OK on your browser?
