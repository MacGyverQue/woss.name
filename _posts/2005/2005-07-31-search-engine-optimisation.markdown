I've been meaning to put this together for a while.  It's my newest idea for a t-shirt I want:

'Search Engine Optimisation' (SEO) seems to be a huge business, the entire point of which is telling you the obvious and charging you for the privilege.  Or that's my impression from the conversations I've been hearing around the office while we're having our web site 'optimised'.  On the other hand, if it genuinely works, then I shouldn't be knocking it &mdash; maybe it would have taken us longer (and therefore been more expensive) to tweak the web site so that it is optimal for search engines to grok the content than it cost to outsource the work.  But I suspect that just writing correct XHTML, minimising non-content (too much ancillary markup, lots of menus and silly widgets), putting the important content near the top of the page and having accurate metadata (page titles, keywords, descriptions) is all that is required.

After all, it's in a search engine's interest to link to useful content, rather than something that's been tweaked to abuse their ranking system.  Which is why the ranking system will constantly evolve and outpace the tweaks...
