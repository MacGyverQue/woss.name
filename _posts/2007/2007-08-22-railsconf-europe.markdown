Finally, I've gotten around to booking up everything for [RailsConf Europe](http:&#47;&#47;www.railsconfeurope.com&#47;) -- flights, hotel, the conference itself.  I'm signed up for the all-day charity tutorial because, well, it's just a fundamentally good idea and well worth supporting&#47;encouraging.  Though I hope Dave doesn't go quite as overboard about charitable donations as he did at RailsConf -- I'm paying a lot of money to go and talk to people about Rails, not to be lectured at about the money I give to charity!  I already give as much as I feel I can afford, thank you very much!

Anyway.

I've been plotting my plans for the time I'm in Berlin on Google Maps, messing around with creating my own map:

<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.co.uk&#47;maps&#47;ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&om=1&s=AARTsJpPAx72iPajZ7IQ3b-6aQ9gdakRRg&msa=0&msid=105450514134305794911.00043834362091d097432&ll=52.468142,13.458252&spn=0.146407,0.291824&z=11&output=embed"><&#47;iframe><br&#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.co.uk&#47;maps&#47;ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&om=1&msa=0&msid=105450514134305794911.00043834362091d097432&ll=52.468142,13.458252&spn=0.146407,0.291824&z=11&source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left;font-size:small">View Larger Map<&#47;a>

I'll be arriving at the hotel around 14:00 local time, I reckon, and I'm signed up for [Bratwurst on Rails](http:&#47;&#47;www.bratwurst-on-rails.com&#47;).  I'm open to making other plans if anybody wants to meet up on the Sunday afternoon?
