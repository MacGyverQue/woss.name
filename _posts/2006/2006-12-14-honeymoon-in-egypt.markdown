Annabel and I are off to Egypt for our honeymoon.  We're meandering down towards Gatwick (via parents and aunties) for a Saturday morning flight which takes us to Luxor, Egypt.  From there we'll be cruising down the Nile to Aswan & back over 7 days.  Then we're off to Hurghada, by the Red Sea, for an all-inclusive week of lazing around reading books and swimming around the coral reefs.

OK, so we're a bit late taking the honeymoon -- we were married on 19th December 2005 -- but it takes in our first anniversary and our first Christmas without visiting one set of parents or another!  Hopefully the weather will be good.  It's looking like the temperature will be in the mid-20s and dry, which certainly beats the rain storm outside our house just now!

It's exceedingly unlikely I'll have Internet access over the next couple of weeks, so I've prepped my laptop with [svk](http:&#47;&#47;svk.bestpractical.com&#47;) and a few projects, just in case I get bored.  Of course, I might take a couple of photographs too.

So I shall wish you all a merry Christmas, thanks for all your support this year, and leave you with this: [A contemporary Scottish version of The Snowman](http:&#47;&#47;irn-bru.co.uk&#47;snowman&#47;index.html)
