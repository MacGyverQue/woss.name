    I''ve noticed the G5 version is a lot snappier on my G5 iMac.'

  content: Hmm, I've just grabbed a processor-optimised build of 1.0.6, from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;homepage.mac.com&#47;ozjason&#47;moz&#47;"
    rel="nofollow">ozjason's page<&#47;a> and I'm trying it out just now.  It feels
    a lot slower than the beta of 1.5 beta 1.  However, the Google Toolbar is back
    (it doesn't appear to work with Deer Park releases yet), which is handy 'cos I
    got to gloat about my own personal web site having a higher page rank than <a
    href="http:&#47;&#47;www.logicalware.com&#47;" rel="nofollow">work<&#47;a>. :-)

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;mozilla.org&#47;products&#47;firefox&#47;">Firefox<&#47;a> has a new beta release: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mozilla.org&#47;projects&#47;firefox&#47;">1.5 beta 1<&#47;a>.  I'm now using it and it seems shiny enough.  First impressions?  The preference pane is more Mac-like.  And the performance -- particularly navigating through history, switching between tabs and creating new tabs -- has drastically improved.  SVG support ought to be pretty neat, if I find a web site with vector graphics on it. :-)  And I'm looking forward to incorporating CSS 3 goodies into the new <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.logicalware.com&#47;" title="Logicalware MailManager Email Response Management System">MailManager<&#47;a> UI.  Fortunately, the new UI code appears to be working well with Firefox 1.5b1 already, so hopefully I've not been doing anything <em>too<&#47;em> evil...
