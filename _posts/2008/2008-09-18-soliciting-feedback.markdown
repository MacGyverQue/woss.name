It's been a while since I posted here, hasn't it?  I'm hoping to be able to pick things up again soon, but I've been absolutely swamped with work and family life...

I'm in the process of developing a brand new site for [Rubaidh](http:&#47;&#47;www.rubaidh.com&#47;) and integrating it properly with [Notes from a Messy Desk](http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;) so that they become a more cohesive whole.  Apart from anything else, it saves me having to maintain a separate news section on the Rubaidh web site, and it reminds visitors here that I'm available for hire (hint, hint!).

Anyhow, as part of the revamp, I'm looking to collect some feedback on Rubaidh's work so far.  Part of that work has been writing and building this blog over the past few years.  So this is where you folks come in.  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.surveymonkey.com&#47;s.aspx?sm=CeJREnitsTrrw2Ex1JQDMQ_3d_3d">Please fill in this survey<&#47;a> and give me some feedback on what you think of my writing and our open source software contributions.
