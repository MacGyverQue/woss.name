I have had call to contact a few companies this week about particular technical issues.  Two in particular stood out and I'd like to contrast them with you.

First up was [FiveRuns](http://www.fiveruns.com/).  I was messing around with my [Manage](http://manage.fiveruns.com/) account, updating some atrophied configuration (it's one of these services where it's good to have when I need it, but I don't need it every day).  I managed to break something by completely nuking one server from the control panel, removing the detector, and beginning the install again.  Once installed, the server wasn't showing up in the dashboard, though the individual applications and services were accessible.

Anyway, the problem is irrelevant.  I fired off an email to support first thing in the morning (UK time).  Naturally, FiveRuns are a US company and I didn't expect a response for a while, so I forgot about it.  Early in the afternoon, I get a response from Rachel asking specific technical questions which would help her resolve the problem.  Clearly, this was somebody who understood the product and had researched the problem -- that the Solaris detector wasn't registering -- before getting back to me.  In fact, it turns out that the Solaris detector wasn't starting because it couldn't see the free disk space on one of my partitions (a ZFS/permissions problem) and Rachel's pointer got me looking in the right place straight away.

I followed up with a couple of thoughts.  Less than fifteen minutes later, Rachel got back to me again and we'd resolved the problem.

This isn't the first time I've had cause to contact FiveRuns for assistance.  In fact, I recall one particular instance where I had fired off 8 support requests before breakfast, and they were all resolved within the day.  Some of those issues were escalated to members of the development team who got in touch directly to help resolve the issue.

Let me sum up here before moving on: FiveRuns have consistently been the best customer experience I have encountered in the web world.  If you are services company online, you should be asking them how they do it.

Now the contrast.  I've been a customer of another company since (according to the signup mail) August 2007.  Their product is awesome: basically they supply the most rock solid, reliable DNS service available.  There's no doubt about that.  However, their customer service is appalling.  On 15th October, I fired in a billing enquiry because one of the reports  was showing incorrect values, suggesting that I would be charged overages which I wasn't due.

I received an automated acknowledgement immediately and, later that day, an email from a representative saying they were looking into it.

Let's now fast forward to early December.  We'll assume that I've been so busy I didn't notice they hadn't followed up on my support query for 45 days.  I happened to be updating a DNS record and figured I'd check the reports to make sure it was now showing the right value.  Nope.  I then checked through my email to see if I'd somehow missed the reply.  No.  They just hadn't resolved, or followed up in 1.5 months.

So I decided that was the last straw and followed up to say I was cancelling the account and moving elsewhere.  Since then there's been a flurry of email, mostly telling me that I have a contract and I'm obliged to pay them money every month 'til doomsday.  We're currently quibbling over the part of the contract which states that "under customer satisfaction policies as $company offers from time to time for the Services, Customer may terminate this Agreement."  I have yet to receive an answer as to whether failing to answer billing queries within 45 days is acceptable under their "customer satisfaction policies".  If it is considered acceptable, I'm sure I'll let you know.

Finally, let me sum up here, too: it doesn't matter how good your product is, if you have poor customer service, you will lose customers.  And products are not difficult; somebody will come along with a similar product one day and your only differentiator will be your customer service.
