So I spent most of the weekend (and part of today, in the background) installing bits and pieces on the shiny new thing.  It's taken 'til this afternoon to figure out what's missing.  Everytime there was a *blip* from an application (usually somebody logging in or out of some messaging service) I'd look at the top right of my screen and wonder "what's that?"

This afternoon it struck me what I was missing:  [Growl](http:&#47;&#47;growl.info).  The notification service that an increasing number of applications use to tell you about strange things happening.  Now that it's installed, suddenly things make sense.  When Adium goes *ping* I can tell without switching to it that it's because broonie has appeared online.

If only such a service was included in Leopard and tightly integrated into *every* application...

Of course, the first thing I downloaded and installed was [Quicksilver](http:&#47;&#47;quicksilver.blacktree.com&#47;).  It took me a while to remember how to launch my web browser, search, download, install and launch it, all without the aide of Quicksilver to enable these mundane tasks!

It took 'til writing email this morning to install [TextExpander](http:&#47;&#47;www.smileonmymac.com&#47;textexpander&#47;) when I wrote 'chrs' and wondered why it didn't *bloop* and expand into my sig.

It's amazing what your fingers get used to doing and the applications you find you're lost without when you start again.
