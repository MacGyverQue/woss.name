Well, maybe not the debauchery, really. :-)  I've had a fantastic weekend, mostly spent 'out drinking with the lads'.  It's ages since I've done that, and it was great to catch up with people I've not seen in far too long.

Friday evening was spent in the Regent, having met <a href="http://drossy.net/blog/">Derek</a> off the train.  They had the lovely Orkney Dark Island on tap (which seems to have become a regular occurrence since Annabel &amp; I moved -- if only they'd taken my hints sooner!).  Lots of lovely people came along and joined us for a pint or two (Brian, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/broonie/">Broonie</a>, Charlie and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/render/">Denver</a>), some of whom had accidentally failed to return to the office after lunch, so were already onto the girlie drinks. :-P

On Saturday, after being introduced to <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/war3/">Warcraft III</a> by Derek, we headed into town to sort out kilts.  He's been measured up, and we now have a complete cadre of wedding part kilts sorted out.  Everyone is wearing the Argyll jacket and waistcoat, an Edwardian shirt, a maroon ruffle-y-ish (OK, I've no idea what they're called!) tie which will match the bridesmaids' dresses, socks, shoes, sporran, that kind of thing.  Just so's the photographs look a little less dull, we've given everybody free reign on which tartan they want to wear.  I'll be in the Matheson Ancient Hunting tartan (my dad and I are buying our own kilts, rather than hiring, for the occasion).  I can't quite remember what everybody is is has decided on, though I do recall that at some point, Mark still has to pop in and make his choice...

Hopefully my kilt and my dad's should be ready sometime this week.  Well, fingers crossed, anyway, it was supposed to be ready by November 5th, but their supplier was out of stock of the material!

We then nicked into The Regent to pay the bar tab I'd escaped without fessing up for the previous night.  Oops.  And while we were there, sampled another Dark Island. :-)  As is traditional whenever Derek and I meet up, there was Pizza Hut involved, for a late lunch, to line our stomachs for the night ahead.

And onto the Holyrood, just a tad early, at about 5pm.  We were the first customers.  Fortunately, it busied up quite quickly, and the motley crew of fellow revellers joined us: Brian, Broonie, Calum, Moray, Colin, Andy (aka Scum), Chris and Jon.  I'm sure I've forgotten somebody but, well, by that point, it may be understandable.  Let's just say that tequila may make me happy at the time, but it gives me a hell of a sore head the next day!  And as for the sambucca?  Chris, you are evil!

When we'd drunk the Holyrood dry (first the IPA went off, then the Lia Fail, then the Old Speckled Hen), we headed up to the Auld Hoose.  There's where my memory starts to fade, really, just that I wound up sitting at a table, talking to folks on bar stools behind me because they couldn't find any proper-sized seats, and winding up with a crick in my neck from doing so...

Chris, by this point, was formulating evil plans.  At least I suspect it was Chris -- odds on bets he was one of the conspirators! -- but Jon very kindly stepped in and pointed out that perhaps we should head to Teviot, for Ascension.  What a good idea!  I spent much of the rest of the evening bouncing around to cheesy gothy music and nearly failing to fall over.

Sunday?  Well, let's just say Sunday didn't really happen.  I eventually dragged myself out of bed just before 3pm.  Derek and I spent the rest of the afternoon playing Warcraft III, swapping power cables to allow batteries to charge -- somebody appears to have disappeared off to Barcelona with my 12" PowerBook and, more importantly, the power cable for it, which is the only PowerBook adapter in the house! -- till there was no juice left in either of them.  Pizza was order -- Dominos this time -- and we watched The Day After Tomorrow.  I decided that 6 hours was more than enough to be awake for, and went back to bed.  Hmm, not exactly the best host in the world, eh?  Oops.

Still, a most excellent weekend.  Thanks, guys, for making it so much fun. :-)  Though I am looking forward to picking up Annabel at the airport this evening.  I miss her...
