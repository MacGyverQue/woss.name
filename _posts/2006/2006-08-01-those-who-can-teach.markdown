Time to unveil a little secret: [Rubaidh Ltd](http://www.rubaidh.com/) has teamed up with [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) so I can deliver a number of Skills Matter's courses.  So far, I've been certified on [Test Driven Development with Java](http://skillsmatter.com/tdd-test-driven-development-java-course).  Well, Java is the example language used in the course notes, but it really teaches the concepts behind Test Driven Development (TDD) and the practical stuff can work with pretty much any xUnit (though [JUnit 4](http://www.junit.org/) does have some pretty neat features!).

Over the coming months, I'll be certified on a number of other courses, including their entire Ruby, Rails &amp; Ajax curriculum.

So if you're looking for me to come and teach you all about, you know, stuff, look out for upcoming courses in Edinburgh, or book me to come to your company!
