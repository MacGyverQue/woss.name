  content: <p>Yeah, I just found out about the single space thing recently.  I was
    always brought up to use the double space.  The trigger for me was the predictive
    text in my new Nokia E65 -- it turns  into '0', which bugs the hell out of me!</p>

  content: <p>If memory serves, proper typesetting leaves a larger space between sentences
    than between words to make it easier to read (but not twice as much).  Double
    spaces are useful in monospaced text to keep the distinction, but as you're using
    Word and HTML that shouldn't matter, as you'll get whatever the application decides.  Unless
    Word is being crap, that is...</p>

  content: ! '<p>The multiple literal spaces after a full stop does have special semantics
    for some typesetting systems (including TeX) which use it to distinguish between
    that and things like ''Mr.'' which should be set with less space between the ''.''
    and the next word than a sentence break (although there''s no need for that to
    be a double space and obviously when things are justified the spaces aren''t all
    the same size anyway). Other than that typesetting systems will generally ignore
    the number of spaces when they flow text.</p>


    <p>Like Jonathan said conventions for fixed width fonts are something else again.</p>'

  content: <p>On this topic, can anyone tell me how to set up Word 2007 to automatically
    put 2 spaces before a new sentence.  Unless I am losing my mind dealing with this
    ponderous program (always a possibility) there used to be a setting for this but
    I cannot find it again.</p>

One of the companies I'm contracting for just now (which is actually nearing the stage where I might be able to talk about some of our fun, exciting work over the past several months!) has an editorial aspect to the business.  They receive manuscripts from authors and they are passed through an Editor who copy-edits and proofs them before they go much further.

It turns out that the editorial policy in the office is to have a single space between sentences instead of a double space.  I personally always use a double space and thought that was the accepted standard -- you learn something new every day!  Like me, most of the authors submit their manuscripts with double spaces.  We were talking about ways to automate the replacement (mostly with find-and-replace in Word for now), but a thought occurred to me.  These documents are destined solely for the Internet, and in mostly cases will only be rendered into HTML for a browser.

So, I'm wondering: does it matter?  Do web browsers respect the number of whitespace characters between sentences when they render?  Or do they just think "hmm, it's whitespace, I'll put in a fixed bit of whitespace"?  Or, even better, since it's a stylistic convention, is it controllable through CSS?

Yeah, this is a lazyweb request. :-)

**Update**: OK, let's test:

Single space. Double space.  Delimiter.
