Hmm.  Clearing up the plethora of open windows and tabs on my desktop this morning (before restarting to apply the Mac OS X 10.4.7 update), I noticed a few interesting browser tabs:

* 2 x Nintendo DS for sale on eBay.
* [Brain Age](http://www.brainage.com/launch/index.jsp)
* [Tetris DS](http://www.tetrisds.com/)

It wisnae me!  I suspect somebody might be tempted by [Dixons Tax Free](http://www.dixonstaxfree.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=dixons.more&action=full&id=16) at the airport this afternoon...

Ooh, I see it has a slot for Game Boy Advance games.  At last I might be able to play the games I bought a few years ago with my GBA that I then decided was a pile of crap because you couldn't see much due to the lack of backlight!

And today's silly question:  what's the difference between the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo DS Lite?  Apart from the Lite version having just been released?
