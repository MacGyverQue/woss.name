		<div class="delicious-link">[Glancing alternative song structures with Graphviz](http://www.whatspop.com/blog/2006/11/glancing-alternative-song-structures.cfm)</div>
		<div class="delicious-extended">FInite automata of song lyrics for 7 songs.  Well worth looking at the full-size images.  I wonder how much effort it would be to do this sort of thing on a grander scale, trawling one of the lyric archives...?</div>

		<div class="delicious-link">[Using with_scope in fat models and skinny controllers](http://errtheblog.com/post/41)</div>
		<div class="delicious-extended">I'd heard that using with_scope in conjunction with around_filter was evil.  But I'd never really seen a use for with_scope until today.  When I realised it would DRY up one of my models quite nicely!</div>
