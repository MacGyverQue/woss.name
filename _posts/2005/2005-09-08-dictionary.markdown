  content: <p>I always have terrible trouble with comment-related plugins that require
    me to put some line in the comment loop; I can never seem to find the right spot.
    Can anyone tell me where I should put the php line in my comments loop? I haven
    not modified anything much, and I would be very grateful. Thanks!<&#47;p>

Note to self:

<blockquote>
<strong>celiac<&#47;strong> <em>|&Euml;&OElig;si&Euml;¬êl&Eacute;&ordf;ak|<&#47;em> ( Brit. <strong>coeliac<&#47;strong>)
<dl>
<dt>adjective<&#47;dt>
<dd><ol>
	<li>Anatomy of or relating to the abdomen.<&#47;li>
        <li>Medicine of, relating to, or affected by celiac disease : a celiac child.<&#47;li>
<&#47;ol><&#47;dd>
<dt>noun<&#47;dt>
<dd><ol><li>a person with celiac disease.<&#47;li><&#47;ol><&#47;dd>
<&#47;dl>
<&#47;blockquote>

as opposed to:

<blockquote>
<strong>celeriac<&#47;strong> <em>|s&Eacute;&ordf;&Euml;&OElig;l&Eacute;&rsaquo;r&Eacute;&ordf;ak|<&#47;em>
<dl><dt>noun<&#47;dt>
<dd><ol><li>celery of a variety that forms a large swollen turniplike root that can be eaten cooked or raw.<&#47;li><&#47;ol><&#47;dd><&#47;dl>
<&#47;blockquote>

Hmm, is that a homophone, a homonym, or just me being stupid? :-)
