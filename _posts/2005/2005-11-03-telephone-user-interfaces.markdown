This is a request to anybody that develops user interfaces for 'digital' phones (the one I have on my desk talks Q.931 -- ISDN -- I think).  A real, live, hook button is actually quite useful.  OK, it looks really cool if there's no button in the cradle to detect if the handset has been replaced (ooh, look, it just knows by <em>magic</em>!) and I'm sure there are reliability problems with such switches.

But see when you've got the phone against your ear, you can't hang up!  So, while making several calls, you have to replace the handset and pick it up again.  Worse still, if you're listening to a ringing tone and nobody appears to be about to answer, what happens if they <em>do</em> answer somewhere in the point between the phone leaving your ear and hitting the cradle?  They're going to think somebody's been really rude and hung up on them!
