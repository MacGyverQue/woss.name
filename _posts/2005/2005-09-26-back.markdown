Well that's us just arrived back in Musselburgh, with a pair of cats obviously pleased to see us!  I have over 15 pages of 'paper blog' to type up at some point in the near future, detailing most of the week we were away, but first things first ... I need coffee, food and sleep.  Not necessarily in that order!  The holiday was wonderful, totally relaxing and just what I needed.
