Yes, I have been watching <a href="http://www.buffyworld.com/buffy/season1/summaries/08_summ.htm">I Robot, You Jane</a> recently. :-)

So I've been playing around with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, yet another networking tool, this time with more of a business focus.  It's been a popular conversation around the office recently with us currently looking for opportunities to market <a href="http://www.logicalware.com/">MailManager</a>, trying to see where one of us might have an 'in' to an organisation.  Mostly it's just interesting to see what (ex-) colleagues are up to these days and who I happen to be only a couple of degrees of separation from professionally.  I suspect it will languish in the same way as my <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> account has, but you never know -- it could always be useful.

So, if you're already on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> (or aren't, but feel like trying it out), do feel free to add me as a connection.  My primary email, as always, is <a href="mailto:mathie@woss.name">mathie@woss.name</a>.
