What's still to be done on the web site.  Some of it is stuff I'd like to get done today, some, I guess, is stuff that will take a while to get around to.  But here goes, off the top of my head:

<ul>
<li>Get a photo gallery installed.  I'm really liking the look of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gallery.sf.net&#47;" title="Gallery">Gallery<&#47;a> version 2, which is in its final beta release, ready for release candidate status.  It's a natural progression, since I've been using version 1.x forever.<&#47;li>
<li>Integrate the photo gallery into wordpress.  I want to make it really easy to take pictures, tweak them, upload them and blog about them.  Maybe <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;" title="Flickr Photo Sharing">Flickr<&#47;a> is the way to go for that, leaving a photo gallery as a store for more permanent albums?<&#47;li>
<li>Incorporate the content from my old <a href="http:&#47;&#47;plone.org&#47;" title="Plone Content Management System">Plone<&#47;a> site.  It's still running on a server at work, just not available by any means other than an SSH tunnel just now...<&#47;li>
<li>Write some mod_rewrite rules to redirect people from the old locations of stuff on my site to the new ones.<&#47;li>
<li>Sensiblify the categories.<&#47;li>
<li>Customise the layout some more.  There's still bits I don't really like about it.  First off, the blue header underneath the messy desk photo that slides in -- that can go!<&#47;li>
<li>Find a use for the mediawiki installation I've got kicking around in the background.  (No, I'm not linking to it 'til I've got it reasonably well setup -- otherwise I'll be finding it full of cows!<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

And in a more general geeking-related to do list:

<ul>
<li>Get the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wedding.mathieson.name&#47;" title="Annabel and Graeme's Wedding">wedding web site<&#47;a> done before Annabel starts threatening to divorce me!<&#47;li>
<li>Having transferred my dad's email across to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dreamhost.com&#47;r.cgi?wossname">DreamHost<&#47;a> I should really get it to poll his POP3 mailbox at his ISP to pick up mail.  Otherwise he's not going to have any new email ever again.  That needs to be done before he gets back from holiday.  Erk, I suspect that might be today or tomorrow!<&#47;li>
<li>Sort out my photography workflow and start organising images instead of just dumping them in a folder.  I've gotten really out of sync since I started shooting in RAW format and discovered that iPhoto 5 doesn't support the Canon EOS 350D's RAW format.  (Thanks, Canon, for tweaking it so applications all have to play catchup!)<&#47;li>
<li>Get away from the computer and do stuff in the real world!<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

OK, the last isn't going to happen any time soon, eh?
