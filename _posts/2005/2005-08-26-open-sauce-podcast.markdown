I forgot to mention this when it was first released.  We (and I mean the royal 'we' -- it was mostly Pete and Andy) have produced our first Podcast: [Open Sauce Podcast #1](http://logicalware.blogspot.com/2005/08/open-sauce-podcast-1.html).  It features Andy talking about venture capital investment &amp; MailManager, Patrick Harvey (Green MSP) talking about open source software in Scottish government and dirty techno from one of the DJs at Pure.  You can grab an [mp3](http://www.archive.org/download/OpenSaucePodcast1/opensauce1.mp3) or an [ogg](http://www.archive.org/download/OpenSaucePodcast1/opensauce1.ogg).  It's already prompted an article from ZDNet News on [Open source awareness growing in Scotland](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39215164,00.htm).

You'll be relieved to here that I <em>don't</em> appear on this one in any way.  :-)
