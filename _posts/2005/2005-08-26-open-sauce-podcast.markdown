I forgot to mention this when it was first released.  We (and I mean the royal 'we' -- it was mostly Pete and Andy) have produced our first Podcast: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;logicalware.blogspot.com&#47;2005&#47;08&#47;open-sauce-podcast-1.html">Open Sauce Podcast #1<&#47;a>.  It features Andy talking about venture capital investment &amp; MailManager, Patrick Harvey (Green MSP) talking about open source software in Scottish government and dirty techno from one of the DJs at Pure.  You can grab an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.archive.org&#47;download&#47;OpenSaucePodcast1&#47;opensauce1.mp3" title="Open Sauce Podcast #1 (MP3)">mp3<&#47;a> or an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.archive.org&#47;download&#47;OpenSaucePodcast1&#47;opensauce1.ogg" title="Open Source Podcast #1 (Ogg Vorbis)">ogg<&#47;a>.  It's already prompted an article from ZDNet News on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.zdnet.co.uk&#47;0,39020330,39215164,00.htm">Open source awareness growing in Scotland<&#47;a>.

You'll be relieved to here that I <em>don't<&#47;em> appear on this one in any way.  :-)
