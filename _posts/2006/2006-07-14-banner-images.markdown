Apparently I'm having a slightly distracted day.  I should be fiddling around with portal catalogues in [Plone](http://www.plone.org/) and I should be creating a simple photograph gallery controller in [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) but instead I'm fiddling with my blog...

If you visit the [home page](http://woss.name/) (or any other page, for that matter, just not through your RSS aggregator!), you'll now be treated to a selection of my photographs that I reckon work reasonably well cropped in about 7x2 format.  Keep hitting refresh and you should get a new one each time.  OK, if you can't be bothered hitting refresh, you can see them all [here](http://woss.name/wp-content/themes/k2-svn/images/headers/). :-)
