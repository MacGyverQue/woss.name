Last year over 100 attendees and speakers from around the UK, Europe and US came together in Edinburgh for what keynote speaker and RailsCore member **Michael Koziarski** recently described on stage as *"the best small conference"* he'd attended.

**Scotland on Rails is pleased to announce the Conference will be running again in 2009 and the call for proposals is now open.**

The venue is the same, University of Edinburgh's Pollock Halls, but the dates are a week earlier.

**Thursday 26 March** will be the charity tutorial day &ndash; a whole day tutorial in Ruby and Rails taught by RailsCore alumni and iPhone programmer **Marcel Molina Jnr** and long-time Ruby programmer, Pragmatic author, and jazz saxophonist **Chad Fowler**.

**Friday 27 and Saturday 28 March** will be the conference proper. We have already confirmed **Marcel Molina Jnr** and **Giles Bowkett** for the keynotes, and are now soliciting session proposals.

We are hoping for a mix of new and experienced speakers, targeting both new and experienced Ruby programmers. All sessions on Ruby, Rails, or associated technologies and techniques will be considered. This includes, but is not limited to:

* experience reports
* scaling
* security
* testing techniques
* alternatives to the normal Rails stack

Please send submissions as plain text attachments to <submissions@scotlandonrails.com>. We will be manually checking and acknowledging submissions &ndash; if you do not hear anything in 24 hours chase us up.

The closing date for submissions is December 1st 2008.

For more information on the conference and to be informed when registration opens, please [visit the Scotland on Rails web site](http:&#47;&#47;www.scotlandonrails.com&#47;) and sign up to the mailing list.

&mdash;- Paul, Graeme and Alan
