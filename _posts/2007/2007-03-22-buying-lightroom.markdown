  content: <p>Mathie, did you really see any advantage to lightroom over aperture
    (if you've been using it)?  I downloaded the LR trial but haven't had much time
    to play with it.<&#47;p>

  content: ! '<p>Greg: Yeah, I''m finding it a lot more intuitive to use.  The way
    it uses the IPTC metadata (I''m a metadata freak!) to organise photos alone makes
    it worthwhile for me.  And I''ve found the editing to be much more ... umm, I''ve
    used the word intuitive already, haven''t I? :-)<&#47;p>


    <p>I''ll post more detail about a project I''ve worked through with it in a couple
    of days, so long as SWMBO lets me buy it!<&#47;p>'

  content: <p>Hmm.  Seeing how I just bought a new Nikon D80 body and three lenses,
    I'm not sure I should shell out the dough for it; or maybe I should. :)  Keep
    us posted please!<&#47;p>

  content: ! '<p>It really pisses me that Apple have their own "UK TAX", most things
    seem to cost near 1&#47;3 more than they do in their US translated prices. I hardly
    believe that has anything to do with transporting goods. We are closer to China,
    right?<&#47;p>


    <p>Oh, and when are they going to get their act together, and allow us to download
    movies via iTunes :-(<&#47;p>


    <p>BTW, anyone been reading all the hacks to Apple TV, looks well cool.<&#47;p>'

So I'm at the [Adobe Store](https:&#47;&#47;store2.adobe.com&#47;cfusion&#47;store&#47;index.cfm?store=OLS-UK&nr=0#view=ols_prod&loc=en_gb&store=OLS-UK&categoryOID=1609645&distributionOID=103&nr=0) ready to buy Lightroom.  Well, I'm not actually going to buy it yet, since I still need permission from She Who Must Be Obeyed which will hopefully happen soon because I've only got one day left in the trial...  Anyway, I'm reckoning that I don't have the patience to wait for the box to be delivered, so I'll go with the download option instead.  I click the drop-down to select 'download' (not that I need to actually download it -- It's already there and installed!).  The price changes.  It **increases** by &Acirc;&pound;4.37!  What's with that?  Is it more expensive for them to deliver content *that they've already delivered* online rather then provide printed manuals and boxes?

Interestingly, the price isn't different in the US store.

Oh, and don't get me started about the fact that Lightroom costs &Acirc;&pound;150 in the UK, *ordered from the same web site for online delivery* yet it's $199 (which is currently &Acirc;&pound;101.38!) for US folks.  I'm in the process of seeing if I can order from the US store... **Update** Which I can't, because it requires a credit card address in the United States!
