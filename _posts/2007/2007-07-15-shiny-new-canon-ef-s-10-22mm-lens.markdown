  content: <p>You'll like that one Graeme.  I use the Sigma 10-20mm and the range
    is fantastic.  It's amazing how much you gain from 10 to 12mm in comarison to
    lenses like the Tokina 12-24mm.</p>

  content: <p>Nice photo.  And the 10-22mm lens looks like yet another one to add
    to my list of reasons to replace my Fuji 9500 with a DSLR.</p>

    <p>Why would she care that you have dust on your sensor? ;)</p>'

There's just something wonderful to me about the effect it has on clouds in a landscape shot.  And being able to photos of a room is a great bonus.

It's also the first time I've really played with Lightroom's develop settings, turning the image into black & white, boosting the blues to get a really impressive looking sky.  And, err, using the spot tool to hide a couple of blemishes. (Don't tell Annabel I said that!)

I'm quite please with how, what was effectively a quick snapshot to try the new lens, has turned out.
