OK, I managed to resist installing Aperture until 17:00.  I'm still in the office -- I couldn't actually wait to get home to have a shot of it!  Installation was a breeze: bung in the DVD, double-click "Install Aperture" and go.  First time I try to run it, I attempt to grab one of the projects I have sitting (unedited) on the hard disk (a visit to Butterfly World a couple of months back) and go to import.  It whirs away for a while, then pops up with "Unsupported file format" for each of the images.  Oh, bugger, I think.  But then I remember that I'd un-applied the fixes for Mac OS X 10.4.3 mentioned <a href="http:&#47;&#47;minimal.cx&#47;2005&#47;11&#47;01&#47;make-os-x-1043-understand-canon-eos-350d-raw-files&#47; title="Make OS X 10.4.3 understand Canon EOS 350D raw files">here<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cyberhq.nl&#47;2005&#47;11&#47;04&#47;make-osx-1043-like-the-canon-350d.html" title="Make OSX 10.4.3 like the Canon 350D">here<&#47;a>, as I'd been having trouble importing photos a couple of evenings ago.  So I grabbed and reapplied those fixes, restarted Aperture and *phew* it works!

So what have I managed to do in 10 minutes without reading any documentation?  Well I've successfully imported a project.  I've figured out how to scroll through the images in full-screen mode.  I've figured out how to 'reject' bad images.  I've learned how to automatically stack images that are taken sequentially (when I'm shooting in drive mode).  And it's all really, <em>really<&#47;em> easy to use.  It's faster than I felt Adobe Bridge was.  Or maybe it just gives me better feedback when it's doing something (I don't mind waiting, I have patience, I just like to know that you've not crashed, or you're not waiting on me!).

On the downside, first-impressions-wise, I'm not convinced by the UI skin they've applied.  Everything is just a little more squashed:

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;wp-content&#47;apertureimportfolders.png"><img src='http:&#47;&#47;woss.name&#47;wp-content&#47;thumb-apertureimportfolders.png' alt='Aperture showing the standard File dialog looking a little squashed' class="centered" &#47;><&#47;a>

I can understand why they did it -- so you can fit all the important stuff on the screen -- but it just jars a little.  I dunno, maybe all the 'Pro' tools look like that?

Memory-wise, it's currently chewing up around 700MB of memory all by itself.  And when I switch between Aperture and anything else, it swaps for a bit.  I suspect that when I'm immersing myself in photograph workflow, I'll actually <em>close<&#47;em> all the other applications, so that, for example, Mail doesn't swap itself back in every 30 minutes to let me know I have new spam.  But it's coping fine on a 1.67GHz PowerBook G4 with 1.5GB RAM, something I was a little worried about (since that's my nicest spec Apple!).

So, summary, first impressions:

<ul>
  <li>Wow!<&#47;li>
  <li>Works with the Canon EOS 350D, with the mods that are kicking around.<&#47;li>
  <li>Performance is reasonably good on a PowerBook G4 with 1.5GB RAM.<&#47;li>
  <li>Again with the Wow!<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

I need to have a proper play with it over the weekend, actually going through an entire workflow with at least one project.  Then you'll get a proper review. :-)
