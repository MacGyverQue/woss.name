<img src='&#47;wp-content&#47;Adium.png' alt='Adium quietly lurking in the corner' class="alignright" &#47;> What, with all this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;talk.google.com&#47;">talk<&#47;a> of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;">Google<&#47;a> introducing an instant messaging service, I meandered onto trying out the latest version of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.adiumx.com&#47;">Adium<&#47;a>, an IM client for Mac OS X.  I've been using iChat since the middle of 2003 when I made a conscious decision to stop fragmenting myself across umpteen different IM identities and just use my AIM one.  But people keep talking highly of Adium, and I've only ever tried it out for a couple of minutes before (and discarded it because of those blooming awful noises it makes!).  Now that I've added a few accounts, tweaked my settings a little and generally played around with it, I'm suspecting it could be usable.

So, I'm currently connected to MSN, Yahoo, AIM and Jabber, named as follows (in order of preference!):
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jabber<&#47;strong> <a href="xmpp:mathie@woss.name">mathie@woss.name<&#47;a><&#47;li>
  <li><strong>AIM<&#47;strong> <a href="aim:goim?screenname=Math1e&message=Nice+Blog!">math1e<&#47;a> (Yes, that's a 'one'.  How l33t.  Blame the person that nicked 'mathie' before I got there!)<&#47;li>
  <li><strong>Yahoo<&#47;strong> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;profiles.yahoo.com&#47;mathiewossname">mathiewossname<&#47;a><&#47;li>
  <li><strong>MSN<&#47;strong> mathie@woss.name<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

All you folks that have <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gmail.google.com&#47;">gmail<&#47;a> accounts might want to follow that first link back there -- y'all have the ability to be on Jabber too, now.

Meanwhile, immediately after posting this telling you how to contact me online, I'm off to read a book. :-)
