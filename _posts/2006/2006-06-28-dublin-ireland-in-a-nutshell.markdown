We're off to Dublin for the weekend for a wedding reception in Bray on Saturday night.  But we've got the rest of the weekend to explore Dublin and the surrounding area.  Any recommendations of where we should visit?  Any Ruby&#47;Rails folks fancy meeting up for a swift 'alf somewhere?

I think we're definitely going to wander around Temple Bar for a while, soaking up the atmosphere and looking around the markets.  Annabel would really like to see the [Book of Kells](http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Book_of_kells).  Chances are the [Guinness Brewery](http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;St._James%27s_Gate_Brewery) also has to be done.  Other than that, I'm looking for suggestions, recommendations?
