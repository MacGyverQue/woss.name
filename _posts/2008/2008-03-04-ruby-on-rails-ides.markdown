I'm in the process of developing a new Ruby on Rails training course.  While I personally abhor every full-blown IDE I've tried (intelligent code completion's all well and good, but it has to be faster than just looking up the documentation!), I can see a few advantages for basing it around an IDE:

* Everybody is using the same proscribed tools to work through their examples, rather than me demonstrating concepts on my Mac with [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), while everybody else in the class is stuck on Windows laptops, having to scrape around to find a suitable text editor.  It's a win for screen shots in printed documentation accompanying the course, too.

* For some bizarre reason, the vast majority of people who come to Ruby on Rails courses feel comfortable in an IDE.  Usually [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/).

* Most of the IDEs out there are cross platform, so I can teach on Mac OS X while the students have to hammer away at Windows laptops.  They can also take their newly learned skills back home and feel comfortable working on whatever platform they have at home.

So while I personally don't use IDEs and don't like IDEs, I think I can see the advantage of teaching with an IDE.  I suppose the alternative is to pick one editor (the [E Text Editor](http://www.e-texteditor.com/) would be my default choice since it's not entirely unlike TextMate) and actually use Windows while I'm teaching the course.  But that would seriously cramp my style. :-)

So, there are a couple of things I'm looking for from my loyal audience here:

* Is my thinking right?  Is it better to have one consistent IDE for demonstration and use?  Is the Right Thing&trade; (AKA The Rails Way) not to use an IDE, and therefore should I be teaching all of the Rails Way of things?

* Do you use an IDE to develop Ruby on Rails applications?  Which one?  Why?

* In particular, this is aimed at the Windows folks: if you *don't* use an IDE, how do you productively develop Rails applications?
