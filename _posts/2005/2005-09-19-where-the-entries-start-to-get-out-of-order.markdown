<p>Well this seems to have turned into one of these best-laid-plans things.  It's now Friday morning and I've got about five days of missing diary entries!  OK, so I last wrote four days ago, but that was describing the previous day...  Maybe I should start by writing up Thursday and working back.  At least its details are clearer.</p>

      <p>Thursday started stupidly early, with the alarm set for 05:00.  We were on our way up to the Temple of Apollon (an unfinished temple on a tiny island connected to Naxos by a recently-built causeway) to catch the sunrise!  We arrived in the pre-dawn light, about 06:45, and I started scoping out potential photo opportunities.  Sun rise itself was a little disappointing, really, since the sun rose behind a mountain range and so by the time it was visible it was already too bright.  But I did get a few reasonable shots of Naxos Town, the mountain ranges, Paros in the distance and the temple doorway.</p>

      <p>Lizard spotting wasn't particularly successful either -- I had figured on them being out basking in the early morning sun, trying to warm up their cold blood.  All good in theory, but it was a bit overcast, quite windy and all the lizards were still sensibly cooped up in bed.  I did manage to shoot a couple of them, though.  In fact I filled the 2GB card before breakfast!</p>

      <p>We retired to the nearest open cafe for breakfast, about 09:00.  Poor Annabel was frozen! John had bacan &amp; eggs; Annabel a cheese &amp; tomato toastie with hot chocoloate; me a ham mushroom &amp; cheese omlette with a couple of Greek coffees.  That warmed us all up and woke us up again.</p>

      <p>This was our last opportunity to explore the island with the car and, since we'd slobbed around on Wednesday, there was still lots to do!  First stop was a pair of Kuroi near Melanes.  They were quite different in style to the one at Apollon, both smaller with finer detail.  The first was discovered in somebody's back garden!  The second was further uphill and poorly signposted so I was quite pleased we found it.  A sign near the car park seemed to indicate (though it was in Greek, so there's a lot of guesswork here!) that they had received EU funding to develop the site &amp; make it more accessible.  Clearly it's still a work in progress.  The proper OS-type map of Naxos we bought earlier in the week really came into its own today!</p>

      <p>Next up we drove out to Moutsouna for lunch.  On the way there (in Apiranthos) we were flagged down by an elderly Greek lady.  She spoke no English, but we understood enough to grok that she was looking for a lift and was headed the same direction as us, so she put her bags in the boot -- with many profuse ephkaristas.  The road down to Moutsouna was quite scary -- downhill, lots of narrow, twisty roads, hairpins where the tarmac seemed to hang out over a precipice.  It didn't help that seemingly every time we came to a particularly nasty bend, this lady would cross herself.  3 times!  It was only later that we sussed that these were coincidental and she was really crossing herself every time we passed a shrine.  Just outside our destination, she pointed left onto a dirt track, indicating that she couldn't walk far because of a dodgy knee.  By then I was starting to think she was leading us to the sausage factory, but about a mile down the track she pointed to her house, we dropped her off -- to many more ephkaristas -- and made our escape!</p>

      <p>I'd spent most of that portion of the journey with my nose in the English -&gt; Greek portion of the dictionary.  Every time John said something, trying to communicate with our passenger, I looked up the Greek equivalent and tried to figure out how to pronounce it.  I didn't actually go and say it -- I didn't feel brave enough as I wasn't sure id I'd be right and, even if I was, I wouldn't have understood the response.</p>

      <p>We arrived in Moutsouna around lunchtime.  Which was fortuitous as it seems to be best known as a a fishing port where the waterfront taverns serve up whatever was landed that day.  It would seem that the average business model of the town is to own a boat &amp; a restaurant.  In the morning you go catch the day's fish.  Lunchtime onwards you sit at the back of the restaurant drinking Ouzo, watching others serve and eat your catch.  Nice life. :-)  The only things left on ice when we arrived were a pair of Black Tails and a big pile of sardines.  There was a live lobster or two keeping fresh in the harbour, but we weren't feeling that flash!  John had one of the Black Tails.  Annabel instead opted for shrimp spaghetti, while I had <q>shrimps &amp; fried cheese</q>.  It was listed on the menu as shrimp anyway -- these were more like langoustines.  And the 'fried cheese' turned out to be a lovely hot passatta and feta cheese casserole-type thing.  Alongside that we had what was unanimously agreed to be the best skordalia ever.  It was much sharper and tasted strongly of garlic.  I suspect too that the potato might have been grated (rosti style?) rather than being boiled &amp; mashed.</p>

      <p>The other 'best' about lunchtime was the Retsina.  Poor John was designated driver and didn't get more than a taste.  Most retsina we've had is Kourtaki and comes in 500ml beer bottles, complete with the crown top!  And it tends to be approximately the colour of white wine.  This stuff was in a 'proper' wine bottle with cork and was a much darker colour.  It was fantastic!  We have to find some of that brand to take home  with us!</p>

      <p>Ooh, I forgot to mention -- we stopped off on the way between the Kuros and picking up the old lady.  To take photographs of a wall.  Sounds dull?  Well normally, yes, but this was a dry-stone wall made entirely of marble!  How stunning is that?</p>

      <p>After lunch, we had a closer examination of the mine workings.  Moutsouna was where the cable lift from the emery mines terminated, as this was the only harbour deep enough to cope with boats to export the mineral.  (Emery is very dense and looks not entirely unlike iron ore.)  So there was the end of the cable lift, what looked like a sorting station (there was a bing of dross that didn't make it to the ships), a weighing station and a set of railway lines (and wee buggies) to shift the emery the final stretch across the waterfront to the ships.  Personally, I think there's some beauty to be found in these rusted overgrown works, and so we have a pile of photographs.</p>

      <p>We jumped back into the car and headed along the coast south to Panoramos where we stopped to have a look at a prehistoric acropolis.  Which looked more like a bunch of stones recently arranged in the rough shape of a bunch of small rooms.  As there was the same stone still lying around nearby (and there seemed to be bits piled up to use elsewhere), we remained sceptical as to its provenance.  Perhaps it does show the outline of an ancient acropolis, but I strongly suspect the walls have been 'enhanced' in recent times.  Still, I made a new friend -- a donkey! -- who posed for pictures and attemptd to follow me back to the car.</p>

      <p>The road between Panoramos and Moutsouna is brand new.  So new, in fact, that they were in the process of painting white lines down the centre of the road as we passed!  It was being upgraded from a dirt track to a tarmac road and must have had some EU funding or something, as somebody had gone <em>seriously</em> overboard with the signs.  At one point, there was a de-restricted speed sign cancelling the 30kph limit.  Then, less than 20 yards further down the road, was another sign re-enforcing the 30kph limit!</p>

      <p>On the way back, with Annabel tucked up asleep in the back, we detoured by some of the old disused mine workings part way along the cable lift.  I went out to briefly explore, but was discouraged by the fact that somebody was watching me, standing just in the shadow of one of the mine entrances!  I guess he figured he was far enough in that I wouldn't be able to see him, as he just stood and observed.  But I took that as my cue to leave again!  Next time we're here, I want to bring gear that will allow me to explore (and photograph!) the workings in more detail.</p>

      <p>The road back took us through Filoti, which looks astoundingly beautiful from above, then back along the middle of the three east &lt;-&gt; west roads.  We emptied and dropped off the car, then headed back to the waterfront for an aperitif.  At Captain's Bar, we started with the three varieties of Kitron -- yellow, green &amp; white.  The unanimous decision was that white was best and I suspect we may take back a bottle or two. :-)  THen we switched to cocktails -- me a Rossini, Annabel a White Heather -- while John had a Retsina and Annabel caught up with her diary.  I forgot to bring mine, or we might have a better recollection of other days here, too!</p>

      <p>After drinks we headed for dinner, back to the 'cherub place', where we had:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Spicy aubergine stuff with feta cheese in a sun-dried tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Grilled octopus.</li>
        <li>Taramasalata.</li>
        <li>Skordalia.</li>
        <li>Chick pea, onion, red pepper &amp; dill salad.</li>
        <li>Lots of crusty bread.</li>
        <li>Retsina.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It was wonderful again.  It's the best skordalia that we've had in Naxos Town, and the best overall meal too.  I agree with John that the chick pea salad was underwhelming, but the aubergine more than made up for that!  We were given a complimentary Ouzo to finish off, then headed back to Oasis, the restaurant from the first night, for another bottle of Retsina.  Which having been awake since 05:00, finished us, so we headed for bed.</p>

      <p>Friday's easy enough to write up.  I spent the majority of the day sitting in one cafe or another writing this!  We started out at the beach closest to us where we all had a breakfast of cheeseburgers.  John went snorkelling for a while &amp; I read my book/wrote this.  Annabel read her book.  Then we walked along the waterfront to another beach-like area (it's more like a harbour without boats) at the causeway to the Apollon temple.  I dabbled my toes in the water and read my book (Getting Things Done) while John, and eventually Annabel, had a swim.  We've now retired to a cafe overlooking the harbour (I needed to get out of the sun) drinking an Amstel &amp; waiting for me to finish writing so we can go buy ferry tickets, then head back to the apartment and out for dinner.</p>
