My [Mighty Mouse](http://woss.name/2005/08/03/re-mighty-mouse/) has arrived this morning!  I've plugged it in, installed the drivers (which only work with Mac OS X 10.4.2+ -- for anything else, it just behaves like a standard scroll-wheel mouse) and set it up.  The mouse 'buttons' are odd.  Really it still feels like a single button, but the action it performs depends upon where on the shell you push.  Very bizarre.  So far, I've assigned the left and right buttons to their usual role, the middle button to bring up the Dashboard and the side button to bring up Expos&eacute; (which is pretty much the default).  I'll probably find a better use for the latter two later...  The scroll ball is neat - very sensitive, doesn't take much movement to scroll, but you can just feel it click as it moves, which I really like as a feedback mechanism.  I haven't tried the horizontal scrolling feature yet, since I've only been catching up with my email and what's been happening on [LJ](http://www.livejournal.com/~mathie/friends/).  I think a bit of playing around with photographs in Photoshop is called for at some point today.  Just for testing purposes you understand.

Ooh, I've just discovered something <em>really</em> neat.  If you whisk the scroll ball to the left while you're in a web browser (certainly works with [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox)), it acts like the back button.  And likewise with spinning it right acting like forward.  Of course, I need to <em>not</em> do that accidentally or I'd be likely to lose all these words...
