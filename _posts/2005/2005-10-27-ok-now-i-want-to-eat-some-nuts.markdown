Following <a href="http://woss.name/2005/10/24/nuts-to-curry/">Sunday's incident</a>, I had an appointment with the doctor today, finally registering with a new GP in Musselburgh.  He agreed with me that the best thing to do was to be prescribed an <a href="http://www.epipen.com/">EpiPen</a>.  So I now have this pen-like device in a funny yellow tube, with 0.3mg of adrenaline (Epinephrine).  I'm almost tempted to try some nuts, just to see how it works! :-)
