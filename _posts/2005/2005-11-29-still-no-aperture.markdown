OK, so I'm starting to see <a href="http://www.jennandlucien.net/lucien/archives/2005/11/aperture_mini_r.html">reviews</a> of <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a> from people that have received their copy.  And the web site even claims that it's now shipping.  But not to me, apparently:

<img src='http://woss.name/wp-content/stillnoaperture.png' alt='Still not shipping Aperture' class="centered" />

So I still have to wait another week?  No fair!
