Google have started producing feeds for their news aggregation service.  I've only just added it to my feed reader, but I have high hopes for this being a stunningly useful way to read news.  I have always used <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/">Google News</a> any time I'm wanting to find out about a particular story because it lets me read many different sources' view on the same thing easily.  But it's so much more convenient to have it in my feed reader along with all the other 'news' I read.

You can find out more about it at <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/news_feed_terms.html">Google News Feeds</a>.
