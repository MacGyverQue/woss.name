  content: <p>Hi m8 , i'm the event organiser, the 26 bus has a stop 20 yards from
    the festival site, just get of bus and cross over small bridge over railway line
    , whalaa your there!  this is our 3rd festival , we had EDDI READER last year
    and the atmosphere is always great. tickets can be bought at the Gothenburg in
    Prestonpans or you can pay at the gate, Also playing are THE HUSSY's, mind the
    supernaturals, well the lead guitarist James Mcoll started a new gruop called
    THE HUSSY'S and they are the dogs nuts,  There is links to the bands on my website,
    also the drink is cheap, Hopefully see you there!!!  JOHN WILSON</p>

I just discovered that the [Levellers](http://www.levellers.co.uk/) are playing at some folk/beer festival just outside Edinburgh on June 2nd.  You can find out more about it here: [Prestonpans Music and Ale Fetival](http://www.prestoungrange.org/gothenburg/html/beer_festival_2006/beer_festival.htm).  It's conveniently near the 26 bus route, so should be easy enough to get to.  Unfortunately, Annabel's probably going to be off galavanting with her mum, so I'm wondering if anybody else happens to be going along, or wants to?  I've no idea if tickets are still available.  But it'd be great to see the Levellers live...
