I've decided to try out [Campaign Monitor](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/) in an attempt to have a closer relationship with the clients of my company, [Rubaidh Ltd](http://www.rubaidh.com/).  So far, I haven't actually composed a newsletter -- hopefully that'll be a task for this weekend, alongside updating a web site that hasn't seen any care and attention for a few months -- but I'm collecting subscribers.  In order to subscribe, fill out this wee form:

<form action="http://rubaidhltd.cmail1.com/.aspx/s/114317/" method="post">
<div>
<label for="name">Name:</label><br /><input type="text" name="name" id="name" /><br />
<label for="l114317-114317">Email:</label><br /><input type="text" name="cm-114317-114317" id="l114317-114317" /><br />
<input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</div>
</form>

I promise I won't use your email address for any sort of nefarious purposes (I hate spam too!) and there won't be a massive volume of email -- I'd estimate it'll start at one a month and tail off to 'whenever I remember'.
