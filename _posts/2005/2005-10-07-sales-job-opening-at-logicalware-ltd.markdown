Logicalware currently receive sales leads from:

<&#47;ul>

It is envisaged that leads will continue to be generated from online marketing, the growth of the open source product, direct mail and outsourced telesales.

Action is required to convert these leads to sales and to feedback from the market to the VP Product Marketing.

If you can think of anybody who might fancy this kind of job, maybe even just part time at the beginning, do let me know (and I'll see if I can't arrange myself a finders' fee this time!) or just send an email directly to <a href="mailto:careers@logicalware.com">careers@logicalware.com<&#47;a>.
