After having played around with [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/)'s setting again last night, I discovered [FeedBlitz](http://www.feedblitz.com/), which allows one to subscribe to posts here by email.  So, if you haven't discovered the wonders of RSS readers for keeping up with changes to web sites without having to continually revisit them, now you can get a daily email with all the updates instead, delivered straight to your inbox!

Try filling out the form, to see what happens:

<form method="post" action="http://www.feedblitz.com/feedblitz.exe?BurnUser"><p><label for="email">Enter your email to subscribe:</label><br /><input name="email" maxlength="255" type="text" size="26" /><br /><input name="uri" type="hidden" value="wossname" /> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe me!" /></p><p>Powered by [FeedBlitz](http://www.feedblitz.com)</p></form>

I should point out that I think I gain access to your email address this way (I'm not entirely sure, as I don't have any subscribers yet!) and, if I do, I promise not to do <em>anything</em> nefarious with it.  :-)  You might want to check out the [FeedBlitz privacy policy](http://www.feedblitz.com/privacy.htm) to be sure that you agree with it too.

In other news, I'm considering changing the RSS feeds to a summary only.  Now, personally I dislike this -- I prefer being able to read entire posts straight from [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) -- but I do occasionally get complaints from folks reading by the feed that things are rendered poorly.  I have a stylesheet on the web site that renders things properly so they look pretty when you view them on the site, but that doesn't carry on to syndicated posts, so they're not going to look 'right'.  It only matters when I post code or images I suppose, though -- maybe I should just hide all of them behind a 'cut' tag...  What do you think?
