OK, this is getting silly.  We've had our wedding photographs for over six months now, and haven't really done anything with them -- just a mini album to test [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/)'s book printing facilities.  We've now got a deadline of mid-August to produce a proper photograph album for a mini-post-wedding reception we're having in France.  And all the photographs are **so** good that we can't make a choice!  So we're enlisting your help.  Have a look at the [full set of photographs](http://woss.name/dist/temp_wedding_album/) (just dumped straight out with Aperture's web gallery) and tell us (either leave a comment, or email <mathie@woss.name>) what ones you like best.  For bonus points, if you could provide some captions that would be most helpful for the production of the final web gallery.  For picks or captions, please let me know which ones you're talking about (the number shown just above the image: "Index **n** of 441"; or in the page title in your browser: "Quickie Gallery - wedding\_**nnn**").

As an incentive, and since we're now on quite a tight deadline, I'm offering a copy of the final printed album to whoever contributes most!  Though maybe that's an unincentive? :-)
