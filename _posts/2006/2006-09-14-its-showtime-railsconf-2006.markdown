  content: <p>Will do.  I've decided to take notes on paper though (less rattling
    of laptop keys!) so I'll type them up at lunchtime and in the evening...</p>

    <p>Graeme (apparently) excited about attending (what are essentially) lectures.  Even
    more strange, actually taking notes and intending to type them up!</p>


    <p>Have I managed to slip into some mixed-up parallel universe without noticing?</p>'

  content: ! '<p>peter: Cheeky git! :-P  I''ll have you know that I have over 30 pages
    of hand-written notes so far.  Hopefully they''ll be intelligible enough that
    I can actually write them up tonight...</p>'

Made it!  I'm down in London, ready for [RailsConf Europe 2006](http://europe.railsconf.org/).  I'm sitting in the Congress Centre's main auditorium (very plush and fancy, BTW), awaiting the first plenary session hosted by David Heinemeir Hansson and Kathy Sierra.  And I'm really quite excited about the whole thing.

I'm going to try and take lots of notes over the next couple of days to share with you...  So stay tuned!

Last night's pre-conference party (hosted by [Cominded](http://www.cominded.com)) was a blast.  There was lots of free beer and pizza, a whole bunch of Rails developers attending the conference, and some of the local Ruby community who couldn't make it along over the next couple of days.  It's kinda scary to have people wander up to me and say "Hi, you're Graeme.  I read your blog."  But it's also kind of cool to know that people actually read this thing, so feel free to do that to me. :-)  (I'm the one wearing the Adminspotting t-shirt today, if that helps!)

Looks like things are starting now.  I hope my laptop battery stays the course.  I should really have charged it before I collapsed into bed last night...  I suspect there might have been more beer than pizza in my case!
