  content: ! '<p>Sounds like a good kit.  I unfortunately didn''t have the luxury
    of a car for the last 10 miles at the weekend so stuck with my 20D, the 17-40
    f4 L and 28-135 IS Canon lenses.  I actually only used the 17-40 though.  And
    I packed one of the mini tripods which was exceptionally usefull.</p>


    <p>For a torch, I always carry a Surefire ( http://www.surefire.com )  These are
    amazing lithium torches that have 10 years battery shelf life, weigh next to nothing
    and have the brightnes of a multi D-cell Maglite.  I have a G2 ( http://www.outdoorgarage.com/acatalog/SureFire_G2_Nitrolon_Xenon_Flashlight.html
    ) with me at all times and sometimes my C3 Centurion if I want extra brightness.  The
    batteries last around an hour so I also carry a Petzl Tikka Plus LED head torch
    that gives me almost a day at a medium brightness.</p>


    <p>What cleaning kit do you use?  I usually have Opticlean for lenses which is
    a paint on polymer cleaning system (paint on, peel off with muck like clingfilm).  I''m
    still not sure which sensor cleaning system to buy though, especially given the
    price of them</p>


    <p>As for flash diffusers, try and find a cheap deal on a Sto-fen omnibounce.  These
    slide over your flash and are what most press photographers use.  Should be around
    Â£10 - Â£20.  A flash extender (fresnel lens gadget) may also be handy for some
    distant objects although the zoom in the flash heads is usually quite good</p>


    <p>Nice tripod by the way.  I have the 055 with a ball head which is great for
    steady shots but a little heavy.  I also picked up a half price Velbon Ultra Luxi
    - F ( http://www.velbon-tripod.com/ultra_maxi.htm ) when I bought my Crumpler
    Farmers Double which has quickly become my favourite cabin bag for work travel
    as it keeps my laptop and camera safe</p>'

So, what do you pack in terms of photography gear when you're going on holiday?  We're travelling by car, so there are no real restrictions on what I can carry.  (Not that it's ever stopped me before!)  So, what's coming with me?

* [Canon EOS 350D camera body](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_350d/index.asp)
* Lenses:
  - [Canon 50mm f/1.8 Mk II](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Fixed_Focal_Length/EF_50mm_f18II/index.asp)
  - [Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/ef_lenses/zoom_lenses/ef-s_18-55mm_f-3.5-5.6/index.asp)
  - [Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/ef_lenses/zoom_lenses/ef_75300mm_f456iii_usm/index.asp)
  - [Sigma 105mm f/2.8 EX DG](http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3253&navigator=5)
  - [Sigma 170-500mm f/5-6.3 DG](http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3276&navigator=3)
* [Speedlite 420EX](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=141&modelid=7394) flash
* UV filters for all the lenses (mostly as protection to prevent the front of the lens from being scratched, but Coll does get the highest levels of sunshine in the UK, so they'll have a practical benefit too).
* Circular polarising filter and [Cokin filter system](http://www.cokin.co.uk/pages/cokinP.htm) (with an ND grad. filter) for the 58mm diameter lenses (ie ell but the 50mm prime and the 170-500mm).
* 2x512MB and 1x2GB flash cards.
* [Manfrotto 190CLB](http://www.manfrotto.com/Jahia/cache/offonce/pid/2216?livid=68|69&idx=71) tripod with a [141 head](http://www.manfrotto.com/Jahia/cache/offonce/pid/2336?livid=80|81&idx=82).  And a mini-tripod from tkerby. :)
* Spare batteries and charger, including for the flash.
* [Mini-maglite](http://www.maglite.com/product.asp?psc=2AACELL&pt=R) [sodding-big-maglite](http://www.maglite.com/product.asp?psc=3DCELL) and [Leatherman Wave](http://www.leatherman.co.uk/home/wave/index.htm).
* Elastic bands and plastic bags to protect the camera from the elements.  Elastic bands and tissues are also useful to me as a cheap (and amusing) flash diffuser.
* Cables for connecting to the laptop, along with my PowerBook and Aperture, to download photos at the end of the day.
* Camera cleaning kit.

I've also got the apropos gear for coping with the elements:

* Hiking boots and gaiters.
* Shiny new trousers from Tiso that claim to do everything in the world ever, including blocking UV rays equivalent to SPF 50.  (I'd never noticed clothing advertising like sun block before!)
* A cool hat. :)
* Decent jacket and fleece, and a cagoule.

I think now all I need is the pack horse to carry it all.  Annabel? :)
