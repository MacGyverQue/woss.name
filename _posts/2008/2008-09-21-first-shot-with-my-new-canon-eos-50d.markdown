(It was alleged at the store that they were the only outlet in Scotland to currently have them, and that I was therefore the second person in Scotland to purchase the 50D!  I'd love to know who beat me to the punch and got their paws on one Friday night!)</p>

Anyway, a few first impressions (bearing in mind that I'm upgrading from an EOS 350D, these are not necessarily anything new about the 50D, but a win from the upgrade to the next line up):

* It's a lot chunkier than the 350D.  It fits my hand better, but it's a bit big for Annabel to heft.  That is not a problem. :-)

* The 6.3fps shooting is just terrific.

* My 4GB CF card is apparently only going to hold about 150 photos.  So I've ordered a pair of 8GB cards. :-)

* I'm not going to be giving up Noise Ninja Pro any time soon after all.  There was still *very* noticeable noise between Malcolm's eyes when this photo was taken.  (At ISO 1600 because I'd left the ISO at "auto".)

* My photography workflow utterly relies on Aperture.  And the camera currently doesn't work with Aperture.  Boo.

* The joystick control is really useful for navigating menus and such.  Takes a bit of getting used to because it behaves more like a small D-pad than a joystick though.

* The utterly massive, crystal clear 3" LCD screen (in comparison to the 350D at least!) is just incredible.

* Prints, even those of Malcolm throwing up, are gorgeous.  A4 prints are coming out at >350dpi.

I'm running out of superlatives, so I'll stop now.  Let's just say I'm ... pleased with the upgrade. :-D
