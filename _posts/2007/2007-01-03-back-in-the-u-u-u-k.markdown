Well, finally we're back in Edinburgh, after a fantastic holiday.  It's been an incredible relaxing time over the past (nearly) three weeks, lying in the sun, touring round temples and enjoying a belated Christmas with Annabel's parents.  So I'm nice and rested, ready for a new year.  Of course, I've now got a massive pile of email to catch up on, never mind the colossal number of articles in NetNewsWire.

So I thought I'd start with a short post to say that I'm still alive, though buried under a pile of inboxes!  And there are other distractions to stop me getting things under control in the evenings, namely my shiny new Christmas present from the lovely Annabel:

Dead Rising is great fun, though I seem to have great difficulty actually completing any of the missions or levelling up having, I suspect, spent too long just killing zombies with benches, garbage bins, baseball bats, bowling balls, hunting knives and even potted plants.  The other game Santa brought me was Gears of War, which I've only played briefly, managing to get killed in the training section...

And I'm *very* eagerly awaiting the release of [Mass Effect](http:&#47;&#47;masseffect.bioware.com&#47;)!
