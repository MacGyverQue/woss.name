It turns out that I made a slight mistake with my subversion configuration when I was moving all the subversion hosting across to another machine.  I didn't allow public read access to a couple of repositories I should have, including my plugins!

Anyway, it's sorted now and, for bonus points, you can now access the repository with SSL too, if you so desire.  So, you can access plugins at <http://repos.rubaidh.com/plugins/trunk/> or <https://repos.rubaidh.com/plugins/trunk/>.

Have a great Christmas, and expect things to pick up here again in the new year.  I have plans... :-)
