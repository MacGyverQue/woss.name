    <p>How many computers do you have on 24x7?</p>


    <p>Perhaps you need one of these to see what is using the juice: http://www.pat-training.co.uk/230V_electricity_meter.htm</p>

  content: ! '<p>Neil: There''s only one computer on 24x7 and it spends most of its
    time asleep just now because I''m using my laptop all the time.  Then again, there
    are all its associated peripherals too (Firewire disks, hubs, printers, powered
    speakers) so I suppose it all adds up.  I think I''ll invest in one of those widgets
    and measure how much power that lot does actually consume.  Thanks for the pointer!</p>'

  content: ! '<p>Yikes 14.6 Killowatts. Bloody Hell, what are you doing, running around
    burning open elements all the time. We''re around the 7 - 8 killowatts mark.</p>


    <p>Here''s something good to consider, we''ve got one in the house. http://www.electrisave.co.uk/
    you can get one here www.greenshop.co.uk. It could save you and the world a fortune.
    It basically tells you at all times how much energy your using, and provides an
    sdjustable alarm so that you get a warning when you go over it.</p>


    <p>As far as macs are concerned I don''t think they use all that much when sleeping,
    I also always have a base load of 50W in the house, this is mainly my router,
    and my lintitx mirco server.</p>


    <p>Probably the biggest killer is stuff light, leaving the kitchen light on for
    hours on end. Do you still have incandescent bulbs ( They should be made illegal
    ). Eco kettle is a good one, also on the greenshop site, allows you to very accurately
    measure only enough hot water for a single cup of tea. Don''t leave the coffee
    machine running. Wash clothes, except bed clothes at 40C.</p>


    <p>For the more adventurious, generate your own electricity, see my website. I''m
    just about to sell off all my Amp gear including speakers and multi CD changer.
    I have now installed a car music player in my sitting room, it runs direct from
    DC, and uses no transformers, and about an 8th of the power.</p>


    <p>My 2p,

    Colin.</p>'

  content: <p>Depending on how fine grained your meter is it can be instructive to
    look at how quickly the meter is ticking over with various things turned on and
    off. I've got some good results with that before, anyway.</p>

  content: <p>I have just done a check of my electricity bills over the past two years,
    my usage for a 4 bed semi is working out at over 24 kwh. per day. For more than
    a decade I changed over to low energy bulbs of 20 w or less, about two years ago
    disconnected the immersion heater, don't know what else to do except have my meter
    checked out. Ok we use the w/mc every day, the dryer most days as well as the
    d/washer. Oven is used regularly too. Yes, I have two PC's but switched off when
    not in use. The meter is a new fangled digital type, so don't have that moving
    dial to check.</p>

I've just been reviewing our electricity bill online this morning, as I was reminded it was now available.  I keep having this sneaking suspicion that we spend an awful lot of money on electricity bills, but I can't quite figure out if we're being particularly wasteful, or whether it's just because electricity prices have risen sharply over the past few years.

The house we live in now has gas central heating with combination boiler, a gas fire, and a gas stove top, although it's an electric oven.  So in a way, our electricity consumption ought to have lowered from the flat we moved out of a couple of years ago, which was all electricity (and exceedingly draughty!).  I should check our old bills sometime and see how the consumption compares.

Anyway, over the past year, we've had an average consumption of 14.69 Kilowatt Hours per day.  That's for a two bedroom upper villa with two people living in it, both of whom are out at work most of the day.

So, I wonder.  Are we average?  Or are the neighbours nicking our electricity? :)
