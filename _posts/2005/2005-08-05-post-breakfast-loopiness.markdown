Lets see.  We have 2 cats -- Saffy and Benjy -- chasing each other up and down the hallway.  You can here the claws gripping into the carpet as they attempt to gain purchase round the corner into the bedroom.  We have Tiko, sitting on the table next to me, with the hiccups!  He does (finally!) seem to be settling in OK, though -- he's now taken to having his tummy tickled like he used to and is more insistent about getting scritched.

Jess was being evil this morning.  We are trying to discourage the cats from being up on the work surface in the kitchen, somewhere Saffy & Tiko have previously had free reign of.  So when I wandered into the kitchen this morning, there was Saffy & Tiko prowling around the work surfaces, while Benjy and Jess were sitting expectantly at the food bowl.  I lifted Tiko down.  Jess wandered up and bopped him on the nose.  I lifted Saffy down.  Jess, in turn, wandered up and bopped her on the nose.  At the time I figured she was just being grumpy and mean, but maybe it was really an 'I told you so'...

And sometime since I last vacuumed the living room (Wednesday lunchtime, I think), somebody has been <em>very</em> bad!  They've been pulling up at the corner of the carpet and chewing it.  This has all the hallmarks of Saffy about it as the guilty party, so she's currently being threatened with being packaged up in a box and sent down to London as a belated birthday present for Laura!
