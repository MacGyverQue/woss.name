  content: ! 'I suspect the biggest trouble for syndicated readers is that I''m using
    a class to make the images look pretty.  And of course, the stylesheet doesn''t
    get attached to the feed''s body, so there''s no hint about how I''d like to lay
    it out...  If it weren''t for the fact that it''s hassle to do, I''d not only
    stick in height &amp; width tags, but embed the style in properly...


    You should only have to fill out the info once for each browser you comment from

    people, that is. :-)'
