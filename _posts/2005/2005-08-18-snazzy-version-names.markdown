Looking at some other projects, I realise the major thing that <a href="http://www.logicalware.com/" title="Email Response Management">MailManager</a> is missing is snazzy release names.  In the world of <a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="Debian GNU/Linux">Debian</a>, we have releases named after characters in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0114709/">Toy Story</a> -- hamm, slink, potato, woody, sarge and now etch.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has big cats -- Tiger, Panther, Jaguar -- and the next in line is suggested as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger">Liger</a> in the blogging world.

So, what theme should the <a href="http://www.logicalware.com/" title="Email Response Management">MailManager</a> releases have?  I'm thinking beer or pub names, but it has to have <em>some</em> sort of International appeal, and it probably wouldn't be a great idea to infringe other people's copyright or trademarks.  So what do you think?
