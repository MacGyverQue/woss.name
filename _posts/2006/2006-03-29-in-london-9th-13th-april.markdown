I'm going to be in London from some point on Sunday 9th April (I still haven't booked flights or trains or whatever, so I'm not *entirely* sure when) 'til about 18:00 on Thursday 13th April.  I'm attending a 4-day [Ruby on Rails training course](http://www.skillsmatter.com/ruby-on-rails-course) at Skills Matter.  (Mostly now, I'm feeling that it's going to be a confidence booster, and a chance to pick up on bits of Rails that I've glossed over; I'm surprised at how quickly I've become productive in using it!)

Does anybody fancy meeting up for a beer?  I'll be based out in Romford (my sister and her bloke live there), but I'll be somewhere near Oxford Circus each day.
