So, having switched to a [Macbook Pro](/2006/11/05/macbook-pro/) in the past
couple of weeks, overall I'm extremely happy with the change. It's very fast
and the improved resolution is wonderful (I actually comfortably fit
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) side-by-side on my desktop!).

One thing I'm missing though.  [Desktop Manager](http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/) (for having multiple desktops I can switch between for different tasks) no longer seems to work.  So I wind up with a very crowded desktop, full of terminals, web browsers, IM chats, todo lists and documents, all for different contexts.  Not my ideal way of working...

I'm aware that [Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/) will have [Spaces](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html) which will probably be the perfect solution for me in the long term, but I need something else in the meantime.  I used to use [Codetek Virtual Desktop](http://www.codetek.com/ctvd/) and still have a license kicking around for it, but I note it's not a Universal binary and hasn't been updated in quite some time.  I tried it out again, but something bugged me about it (maybe just a disquiet about running a Rosetta-ed app all the time) so it was quickly uninstalled again.

So, do you have any recommendations for a desktop manager I can use as a stopgap between now and Leopard's release?

**Update** Wow, I've just been pointed at [Virtue Desktops](http://virtuedesktops.info/) by a couple of lovely commenters.  It's been downloaded, installed and is now running happily.  I've got my usual keyboard shortcuts for switching desktops setup now.  And it allows me to nicely bind particular applications to particular desktops which suits my way of working (that way Yojimbo and OmniOutliner sit in my 'GTD' desktop).  Oh, and for bonus fun, it makes use of the [Sudden Motion Sensor](http://www.kernelthread.com/software/ams/ams.html), so hitting my laptop makes it switch desktops.  Cool. :-)
